# Selection Criteria

We are looking for bright, enthusiastic and responsible learners who care for
patients and work well with others. Candidates who are self-motivated and
embrace learning opportunities will thrive in our program. Candidates should
demonstrate strong academic achievements, as well as excellent interpersonal
skills and work ethic.

## Program goals

The McMaster University Diagnostic Radiology Program is designed to produce
strong clinical radiologists.  The program fosters the development of general
radiology skills as well as strong consultative skills.

As a program, we strive to produce radiologists who will be life-long learners
and able to respond to the increasing demands of our exciting, rapidly
expanding medical specialty.

The program is designed to meet the specifications of the Royal College of
Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, utlilizing the CanMEDS framework.  Our
general program objectives have been adopted from those outlined by the Royal
College.  Our program curriculum has transitioned to CBD framework as of July
2022 for the incoming (and subsequent) PGY1 cohorts.

## Selection process goals

We are looking for residents who are bright individuals with strong
interpersonal and problem-solving skills, an equitable, patient-centred
approach to care, as well as high ethical and professional standards. They
must have a strong knowledge of radiology and applicable specialties with the
ability to apply that knowledge clinically.

Our ideal candidate possesses all of these attributes and has a passion for
radiology. McMaster University program is aimed at residents who are
interested in either a university-based or community practice. We have the
capacity to support those interested in research, education and other areas of
scholarship within the practice of medicine.

The program is very keen to have residents from all Canadian medical schools
represented in each resident class. We are looking for the best candidates for
our specialty; therefore, no preference is given to medical graduates of any
particular medical school.

Involvement in research is of value in demonstrating a commitment to scholarly
activities; however, it is not a requirement for admission and thus it is not
heavily weighted in our selection process.

## File review process

Review team composition : Review team is composed of multiple radiologists
(6-8) and our chief residents (1-2) who review all available CARMS
applications.

# Program Curriculum

This residency program is for 5 years.

Program length of training does not exceed the Royal College or College of
Family Physicians of Canada standard.

Our 5 year program is structured to produce radiologists who can supervise,
advise on and perform imaging procedures as a consultant to referring
clinicians.

We stress knowledge, technical skills and communication skills. Residents are
closely supervised throughout the program but are given increasing
responsibility, so that final year residents function as "junior staff".

# FAQ

Q: What qualities does your program look for in a potential resident?

A: We are looking for a candidate who fits well with our program. This
includes a strong academic background, as well as collegial spirit. We are
interested in enthusiastic learners who are happy to be at McMaster.
Congenial, reliable and hard-working residents are usually the most
successful. McMaster recognizes and values collaborative learning - this
philosophy allows each resident to gain from the strengths of their peers.
Recognition and dedication to steady, continued personal study is also key.

Q: Do I need to do an elective at McMaster to enhance my profile as a
candidate?

A: We recognize that medical students cannot do electives at all programs. We
recommend at least one radiology elective (minimum 2 weeks), in order that the
candidate has a clear understanding of what a career in radiology entails. We
do not recommend that students use all of their elective time for radiology
electives - a broad spectrum of experiences is important to assist with career
choices as well as well-rounded medical training. We have matched many
residents to our program who have never been to McMaster for an elective.

Q: Will participation in a research project make me more competitive as a
candidate?

A: Research is not a mandatory requirement for application. We have residents
with extensive backgrounds in research, along with others who have limited
experience. Research experience or publications are secondary to academic
excellence and interpersonal skills.

Q: Is there an opportunity for residents to teach?

A: There are ample opportunities for residents to participate in teaching.
Informal teaching opportunities include medical/elective student and junior
resident mentoring. Residents also participate in teaching the summer
prepartory on-call lecture series.  Our residents participate in clinical
skills teaching, medical school orientation, undergraduate medicine radiology
interest groups and select resource sessions on radiology topics for medical
students and other postgraduate programs.

Q: How do you provide ongoing evaluation feedback to residents?

A: Formal and informal feedback to residents is important. Under our new
Competence by Design curriculum, residents receive feedback through regular
Entrustable Professional Activities (EPA) assessments which are opportunities
for 1-on-1 feedback from radiology faculty. Residents are also evaluated at
the end of each of their rotations with a summative evaluation.

In addition, there are several methods of objective resident evaluation. Two
OSCE examinations are held each year in the fall and spring. These
examinations are structured to mimic the Royal College OSCE examinations. The
OSCE is in electronic bell-ringer type examination, in PowerPoint format, with
10 stations covering a spectrum of subspecialty areas. There is also a formal
Mock Oral examination in Royal College style, held each April (PGY 3-5) and
June (PGY 2) residents. Each of these examinations are scored, with timely
individual feedback given to each resident. As well, there is an annual
multiple-choice examination (ACR) taken by most North American residents.
Subspecialty scores are provided, with peer comparison data from across the
continent.

Finally, each resident meets individually with the Program Director, for 6 and
12 month reviews to discuss rotation evaluations, objective tests and personal
goals.

Q: What research opportunities are there in your program?

A: All residents are required to complete one research project and a clinical
audit during residency. There is an annual resident research day, where
residents present their work. There are a number of faculty persons with
varying research interests. We encourage presentation of these projects at
radiology meetings, as well as publishing their work. There are research
grants available through the Postgraduate Education Office. In addition, the
Radiology Research Committee has funding available for resident projects.

Q: Is there dedicated time provided for research?

A: Time available for research is flexible. Residents are able to obtain
individual research days, in order to meet with statisticians, supervisors or
research collaborators. Our program does not designate a dedicated block of
time.  If a project required a scheduled research block, this would be
discussed with the residency training committee. Our residents indicate
satisfaction with the research time available.  There are designated research
resources available to the residents, including a program-designated
statistician and epidemiology resources.

Q: Is there support to attend scientific meetings or courses?

A: Residents who are presenting a poster or podium research project receive
financial support from the program. The amount available is usually sufficient
to cover expenses for travel, accommodation and meeting registration. Most
residents attend the AIRP in Washington DC, in their PGY 4 year. The program
reimburses the tuition for this course. In addition, each PGY 4 and PGY 5
receives an educational stipend of $1500.00/year. The stipends are utilized to
support educational resource purchases (books, CDs, computer resources) or
conference/review course expenses.

Q: Do most of your residents do fellowships after residency?

A: Historically, 75-100% of our graduating residents participate in a
fellowship program, with most successful at obtaining their choice of
fellowship location and subspecialty.

 Q: What type of fellowship do your residents usually do? US vs. Canada?

A: Canadian and US fellowships. Choice is often guided by subspecialty
interests, as well as family commitments and mobility. Common subspecialty
choices include body/cross-sectional imaging, musculoskeletal and
interventional.

 Q: What percentage of your graduates work in community vs. teaching hospital
jobs?

A: Choice of jobs is influenced by the job market, career opportunities and
subspecialty interests. Our graduates work in both environments. In general,
at least 25% of graduates select a teaching hospital position as their initial
career position.

 Q: What is the success rate for your program at the Royal College
examinations?

A: Our residents are well-trained and well-prepared to sit their Royal College
of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada examination. We have an 10-year 100% pass
rate at these examinations.

 Q: Do many of your graduates return to work in Hamilton?

A: Each year, at least one of our graduating residents is recruited to a
faculty position at McMaster. Although there is a large cadre of former
graduates, there is still a wealth of faculty members who have trained
elsewhere, offering the advantage of varied training perspectives and
experience.

 Q: Do you have residents matched to your program other than Canadian medical
graduates through CaRMS?

A: In addition to Canadian-trained medical students via CARMS match, the
Diagnostic Radiology program typically accepts 1-2 additional candidates via
the International Medical Graduate (IMG) program and/or externally funded
(e.g. Gulf State) candidates.

 Q: Do you envision any upcoming changes to the program?

A: Our program is well-established, with a strong track record of case
material, resident teaching and exam success. With recent updates to the Royal
College training requirements and movement of clinical services at HHS, we
have redesigned our rotation schedule and curriculum to meet requirements and
best meet our residents’ educational needs..  We are flexible to any change in
faculty or hospital services in Hamilton, as our program design is rotation-
based, not hospital-based.
