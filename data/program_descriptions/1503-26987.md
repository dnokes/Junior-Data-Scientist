# Important Information

The Core Internal Medicine Training Program at the University of Calgary
transitioned to competency-based medical education (CBME) in July 2019 with
all trainees entering the program after this date affiliated with [Competence
by Design (CBD)](https://www.royalcollege.ca/en/standards-and-
accreditation/competence-by-design.html), which aims to enhance patient care
by aligning medical education and lifelong learning with evolving patient
needs and empowering learners to more fully engage in their education process.

CBD uses time as a framework for competency assessment rather than the basis
for progression. It is not anticipated that the duration of training will
change for the majority of trainees. Residency training is broken down into
[stages](https://canmeds.royalcollege.ca/en/milestones), and each stage will
have a series of entrustable professional activities (EPAs) and milestones
based on the required competencies. These EPAs and milestones improve learning
outcomes and will involve more frequent, formative assessments within the
clinical workplace to ensure residents are developing and receiving feedback
on the skills they need.

For more information, please contact
[cbd@royalcollege.ca](mailto:cbd@royalcollege.ca).

Communication skills |  Both communication during the interview as well as examples that exemplify this are explored. The ability to manage differences with patients, other physicians, or allied health care members is an asset. Demonstration of an understanding of culturally safe care and respect for difference is an asset.   
Health advocacy |  An understanding of systemic barriers to healthcare for patients, especially patients who experience marginalization, is required for successful applicants to the IMRP. Evidence of explicit bias against people who experience marginalization is not compatible with acceptance to the IMRP.   
Interest in the discipline |  We do not evaluate this interview component.   
Interest in the program |  We do not evaluate this interview component.   
Leadership skills |  Answers provided and past examples are explored to assess this dimension   
Professionalism |  Evidence of a lack of professionalism is not compatible with admission to the IMRP. Evidence of an inability to respond to or incorporate feedback to improve their performance is not compatible with successful application to the IMRP.   
Scholarly activities |  We do not evaluate this interview component   
Other interview component(s) |  During the interview the trainee must demonstrate good listening skills and be engaged throughout.  
Evidence the candidate is able to think through their strong qualities and
areas for improvement (above and beyond honesty) will be explored.

# Program Highlights

**_The strength of our Program is in our People!  _**

 We are very proud of our residents, faculty and administrative staff.
Teamwork and inspiring people to do their best are core values of the program.

 There are many excellent aspects about our program, below are some of the
highlights:

  1. We have made great investments in simulation equipment and have expertise in simulation based training at all sites with a RCPSC accredited Simulation Program.
  2. We have an extremely strong ultrasound (POCUS) and procedural skills program in our residency program.
  3. We have an accredited SIMulation program and trainees have exposure throughout their training.
  4. We have a well established mentorship program in our Department and our mentorship groups meet quarterly
  5. We have excellent research opportunities in the Department and Faculty of Medicine
  6. The University PGME Office has a Vacation Policy which clearly defines the process for vacation requests which provides more flexibility for residents to book time away

**Competency-based Medical Education (CBME) or Competence by Design (CBD)**

Competency-based Medical Education is a national Royal College educational
initiative. The core internal medicine residency programs across Canada
formally adopted this initiative in July 2019. We provide all residents with
an Academic Advisor, as this has been identified as a valuable and meaningful
relationship for the residents.

All trainees in our program are expected to have one or two face-to-face
assessments of Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs) completed every week
and have been asked to complete 6 EPAs per 4-week block. We have been using
the RCPSC ePortfolio portal to track EPAs in Calgary - though this will change
in Fall 2024. A formal Competence Committee meets regularly and reviews the
progress of the trainees - under the direction of the program's CBD Lead and
Competence Committee chair, Dr. Darren Burback.

**Educational support**

We are pleased to be able to support our trainees in providing educational
resource material. This has included a three-year New England Journal of
Medicine (NEJM) Knowledge+ as well as NEJM 360 subscriptions for all trainees
in our program. Trainees are also provided with annual financial support to
support attendance at a conference, and they may apply for additional funds
from the PGME office. These funds may also be used for academic subscriptions.

**Thank you for your interest in the Calgary Internal Medicine program!**

# Program Curriculum

This residency program is for 3 years.

Program length of training does not exceed the Royal College or College of
Family Physicians of Canada standard.

**Program Overview**

Please see our Program website: <https://live-
cumming.ucalgary.ca/departments/medicine/residents/imrp>

_The Calgary Internal Medicine Program adheres to the Royal College Specialty
Training requirements and was fully accredited at our last external College
review._

Each PGY year is composed of thirteen 4-week blocks. The first year includes 6
blocks on the Medical Teaching Units (MTU) located at Foothills Hospital,
Peter Lougheed Hospital, Rockyview General Hospital, and/or South Health
Campus.  Trainees are not assigned to one specific site. and have the
opportunity of exploring all adult training sites. The balance of the year
includes subspecialty rotations including one block of Coronary Care Medicine,
Geriatrics and Nephrology. The remaining blocks are scheduled from the other
subspecialties and may include Dermatology, Endocrinology & Metabolism,
Gastroenterology, Hematology, Infectious Diseases, Medical Oncology,
Neurology, Palliative Care, Respiratory Medicine and Rheumatology. Residents
are given an opportunity after the match to identify and rank their areas of
interest that are considered when the program is preparing the schedules.

During the second and third 'senior' years, residents complete six rotations
as Senior Medical Residents. The balance of the years includes subspecialties,
critical care, coronary care, electives (max three over the core 3 years) and
research electives (max three over the core 3 years). One community GIM
rotation is mandatory and is offered in either Grande Prairie, Lethbridge, Red
Deer, Medicine Hat and at the Rockyview General Hospital (RGH). The RGH C
_ommunity_  Rotation is reserved for those unable to leave Calgary for
personal reasons. Senior residents participate in a rotation draft (ran like a
hockey or football draft) where you are able to have some autonomy over your
schedule for subspecialties and electives while ensuring mandatory rotations
are filled.

Academic Half-day (AHD) is protected on Wednesday afternoons, and includes
lectures, small group learning, simulation based and procedural training and
protected time for independent scholarly activity. In Calgary, we have adopted
a hybrid model of virtual and in-person learning sessions during the Academic
Half Day. Simulation, Procedure, PBL and OSCES are in-person, while most
lectures continue to be held virtually. PGY 3's have protected study time
during their AHD to allow for RCPSC exam preparation.

Resident Research Day, a Resident Retreat, Charitable Half Day and Journal
Clubs are among our special academic activities. Large events such as the
annual Welcome BBQ and Fall Awards Dinner are organized by IMRP and the
Department of Medicine - but there are also many resident-driven events
initiated by the IMRP Wellness Committee like hiking, biking, skiing, snow-
shoeing, pumpkin carving, pub nights etc.

Lethbridge, Yellowknife, as well as in underserviced areas.

The Province of Alberta has made large investments in tele-education and tele-
health technologies.  For example, each of the adult sites has computerized
patient care systems wherein all diagnostic imaging (and interpretations) as
well as laboratory results are available for viewing on-line.

The University of Calgary has numerous on-line journals. In addition, the
University is part of the Canadian National Site Licensing Project (CNSLP).
All online journals, MD consult, as well as the CNSLP can be accessed through
the Internet at any of the teaching sites free of charge. There is a tutorial
on accessing electronic journals during the first week to ensure all the
residents are familiar with this source of information.

**Faculty**

The Internal Medicine Residency Program draws upon faculty from the
Departments of Medicine, Cardiac Sciences, Critical Care Medicine, and
Clinical Neurosciences.  We strive to provide the highest quality of medical
education.  The Office of Faculty Development provides our faculty with many
opportunities to develop and enhance their skills as medical educators.  

The Department of Medicine alone has approximately 450 teaching faculty which
is in addition to those in Cardiology, Critical Care, and Clinical
Neurosciences.  The University of Calgary Faculty of Medicine offers Royal
College accredited residency programs in nearly all medical subspecialties
including: Cardiology, Critical Care Medicine, Endocrinology and Metabolism,
Gastroenterology, General Internal Medicine, Geriatrics, Hematology,
Infectious Diseases, Palliative Medicine, Nephrology, Medical Oncology,
Respirology, Rheumatology and Toxicology and Clinical Pharmacology.  

The Program adheres to the Specialty Training Requirements described by the
Royal College.  General Internal Medicine experiences include those on medical
teaching units, consultation, and outpatient clinics.  Subspecialties are well
represented and include both inpatient and outpatient clinic experiences.  

We have purchased Ultrasound machines and have developed a Procedural
Certification Program for the use of ultrasound in Internal Medicine.  The
Program has invested heavily in simulation equipment and is proud to have
numerous patient simulators at three of the training hospitals.

The Senior Medical Resident Night Float and Emerg Liason rotation was
established with a view to reduce resident fatigue, improve patient safety and
quality of care, and provide a better learning experience on the Medical
Teaching Units. Senior residents on the teaching teams carry out 12 hour call
shifts, as opposed to 26 hours shifts.

The Program is well supported with one Program Director, four Associate
Program Directors, four Assistant Program Directors, four MTU Directors, five
Administrative Assistants, and the tremendous support of the Chair of the
Department of Medicine.  Academic Half-day is protected for all residents on
medical rotations and we place a high value on resident well-being.

The Internal Medicine Residency Program is pleased to provide $500 of
conference funding each academic year for each resident. The conference
funding can be used for subscriptions in lieu of reimbursement of attending a
conference. Additional funding may be available when applied for through the
Post Graduate Medical Education Office (for residents presenting their
research at academic meetings and conferences).

The City of Calgary has a population of 1.5 million and offers a wide range of
recreational and cultural facilities that include theatres, an amazing
Philharmonic Orchestra, opera, ballet, and frequent concerts and performances
by internationally renowned artists. Calgary has an impressive restaurant and
dining scene, with restaurants like Major Tom, River Cafe, Lonely Mouth Bar,
DOP and many others that have been voted among the best in Canada.

Calgary is friendly, culturally diverse and is surrounded by natural beauty.
There is something for everybody - art galleries, festivals and markets;
fantastic shopping, an excellent zoo, professional sports like NHL, CFL,
Soccer and Lacrosse and for 10 days each year we host the Calgary Exhibition
and Stampede. The city has an extensive system of parks, golf courses and
cycling paths and with the Rocky Mountains only an hour away, it is easy to
escape for a day of downhill or cross country skiing, hiking, climbing,
canoeing and kayaking. Calgary has the most hours of sun of any city in
Canada, we enjoy chinooks in the winter and our proximity to the Rockies make
our city a wonderful place to live.

The program's social calendar includes a variety of academic and wellness
events including, but is not limited to a Welcome BBQ, Annual Fall Awards
Dinner, Resident Research Day and a Resident Retreat.

# Additional Information

The program has a collegial philosophy that is mutually supportive. Residents
participate actively in the success and evolution of the program in a variety
of ways including: elected resident representatives to the Residency Program
Committee, involvement in the numerous subcommittees (MTU, Curriculum,
Research, Wellness and CBME), regular Town Hall meetings and a yearly
educational/wellness retreat. There is an "open door" approach that
characterizes the faculty and the program administrative staff.

We believe our two greatest strengths have been the dedication of our teaching
faculty as well as the tremendous contributions and hard work of our trainees.

# FAQ

For the 2025 CaRMS match we will have 30 Canadian Medical Graduate (CMG) and
up to 6 Alberta International Medical Graduate (AIMG) positions available. We
typically interview ~300 applicants. We do keep an interview "waitlist" and
contact applicants who have applied but were not granted an interview in the
event interview spots become available.

We discourage you from selecting Internal Medicine as a “back-up” as this
limits our ability to interview serious candidates, and we would ask that you
be respectful of those who have Internal Medicine as a top choice.
