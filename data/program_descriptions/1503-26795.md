**Electives**

We recognize that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted candidates’ opportunities
to arrange and complete electives and would like to reassure you that a lack
of elective activity this year will not negatively impact your application to
our program.

COVID-19 vaccination requirements:

Please refer to the 'Restrictions' section of the [Ontario eligibility
criteria](https://www.carms.ca/match/r-1-main-residency-match/eligibility-
criteria/ontario/) for messaging regarding COVID-19 vaccination requirements.

**EDIIA Institutional Statement:**

The goal of resident selection is to identify trainees likely to succeed both
in training and, once out in practice, in meeting the health care needs of
patients and Canadian society.  We know that having a physician workforce that
reflects the demographics of the patients that they serve improves health care
outcomes.  There are many populations within Canada under-represented in
medicine (UIM) with a paucity of health care practitioners who are Black,
Indigenous, Persons of Colour, 2SLGBTQ+, from lower socioeconomic backgrounds
and/or with disabilities, and other under-represented in medicine (UIM)
groups. Diversity within training programs has also been shown to improve
training environments.  Queen’s University PGME is strongly committed to
diversity and inclusion within its community for these reasons as well as
being part of the solution to address historic and contemporary inequities.

**Equity and diversity**

We welcome diversity among our trainees and seek to foster an environment that
is welcoming to all, regardless of gender identity, race, religion, or sexual
orientation.

We are committed to advancing equitable and inclusive practices.  Please refer
to the [PGME website](https://meds.queensu.ca/academics/postgraduate/faculty-
staff/applicant-selection) for additional information / resources including
[QHS EDIIA Initiatives](https://healthsci.queensu.ca/academics/edi) and [EDIIA
statements](https://healthsci.queensu.ca/academics/edi/accessibility-
statements) (Indigenous Land Acknowledgement, Anti-Discrimination Statement,
Inclusion Statement, and Statement on Social Accountability)

**Gaps in Training, Remediation, or Professionalism issues**

Please address any gaps in training, remediation, or professionalism issues in
your personal letter as a separate paragraph. This will not count towards your
maximum word count.

career track interest through electives and selectives, including research.**
**

** **

**Electives/Selectives  **

Rotation selection is determined based on the particular interests and career
goals of the individual residents. We encourage residents to obtain broad
clinical and academic experiences before making final career decisions.

Electives include inpatient and outpatient general adult psychiatry,
collaborative mental health care services (shared care), forensic psychiatry,
research projects, psychotherapy, geriatric psychiatry, psychoses, mood
disorders, consultation-liaison, eating disorders, concurrent disorders,
emergency psychiatry and a growing number of other options.

** **

**Academic Program**

Our Academic Curriculum consists of didactic and clinical skills development
aimed at training residents to become leading future psychiatrists.  This
includes organized core didactic seminars, interviewing skills sessions, small
group practices in Phenomenology, Diagnosis and Management and psychotherapy
teaching which occur throughout the year.

Residents have protected time Wednesday afternoons, from 1:00 p.m - 4:30 p.m.
during their PGY-2 to 5.  Journal Club and Wellness Sessions occur monthly at
noon, prior to academic day.

During PGY1, residents attend the summer teaching series.  Sessions include a
number of introductory topics: History of Psychiatry, Diagnosis and
Classification, Resources, Children & Youth in the ER, Adults in the ER, the
Mental Health Act, etc.

The focus in junior years is on small group teaching encompassing core topics
in psychiatry including etiology, phenomenology, descriptive psychopathology,
diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric disorders across the life cycle as well
as interviewing and case formulation.

Residents in their senior years PGY 4 and 5 are involved consolidating
knowledge at an advanced level to prepare for the Royal College examination
and to prepare to work as an independent psychiatrist.  Senior residents
prepare for their Royal College final examinations through practice long case
examinations and PDMs (Phenomenology Diagnostic and Management Practice
Stations).  

Senior Residents have the opportunity to attend Annual Review Courses in
Psychiatry, and are relieved of clinical duties to attend.

Psychotherapy teaching includes theory of psychotherapy practice, research
methodology and critical appraisal.  Residents gain proficiency in cognitive
behaviour therapy (CBT), psychodynamic psychotherapy, interpersonal therapy
(IPT), family, group and couple therapy.  Our program follows the Royal
College Guideline requirements.

Emergency psychiatry rounds (weekly), Geriatric Rounds (bimonthly),  Journal
Club reviews under the supervision of a staff psychiatrist (monthly), and
Psychiatry Grand Rounds (weekly), supplement the core academic teaching.
Individual services have formal case based teaching and specialty specific
literature reviews (weekly).

Practice STACERs or Diagnostic Interview examinations are integrated into
every core rotation. The STACER examinations in the senior years are
integrated into the rotations of the Senior Residency. Residents have multiple
opportunities to meet the STACER requirement by the early PGY5 year leaving
ample time to prepare for the written and oral Royal College Exams.

**On-Call  **

Staff psychiatrists supervise and support resident interaction with patients
in the emergency department. On-call duties are shared among the junior and
senior residents (buddy system for all calls) Residents provide coverage on
weekends, and from 5:00 pm \- 8:30 am on weekdays.  After hours call frequency
is approximately 1 in 14.

**Research Training Program  **

The Department is dedicated to clinical research and provides residents with
opportunities to be mentored by Faculty actively involved in research. The
residents participate in ongoing research projects and are encouraged and
mentored to initiate their own research projects.

The program has two formal streams. Each resident can choose which stream to
pursue during their residency, and there is the possibility of switching
streams if necessary.

Residents choosing the General Research Stream will be expected to participate
in all aspects of research but do not have to do this as part of a single
project or present or publish as first author. In PGY4, they will be expected
to produce a manuscript or summary of projects to show they have met the
research training requirements. With permission, residents in this stream can
switch to the Intensive Research Stream during the first 2 years of their
residency.

Residents choosing the Intensive Research Stream will be expected to
participate in all aspects of research. They will be expected to be first
author on a submitted manuscript and present at the departmental research day
and a national or international conference. These residents will schedule
research electives.

Guidance is available from departmental members for study design methodology
and statistical analysis as well as preparing projects for publication in peer
reviewed journals.

The Clinician Investigator Program (CIP) is also available for Queen’s
psychiatry residents. The CIP's mandate is to assist in the career development
of clinician/investigators by providing a formalized postgraduate educational
program that fulfills the existing clinical specialty training requirements of
the Royal College, as well as a minimum of two years of structured rigorous
research training. Up to one of the research years may also be credited to
fulfill the individual's specialty requirements. It is preferred that the two
years of research be sequential.

The Postgraduate Program Director is available for ongoing consultation and
will meet with each resident regularly.  The Resident body meets with the
Program Director monthly as a group to discuss their program and address any
concerns that might relate to their training.
