# General Instructions

Program application language: English

We ask that candidates to the UBC Program apply to each of the distributed
Site Programs separately.  For clarity, these are: Vancouver, Fraser,
Vancouver Island, and Interior sites.

All documents/submissions including a separate personal letter for each site
should be submitted as requested.

A separate candidate rank order list is completed by each site, and candidates
are able to rank each site individually.

It is important to note that while CaRMS considers the four sites to be
separate programs for ranking purposes, the UBC program acts together when
selecting candidates for interview; i.e. there is only **one** interview that
covers all four sites. **CANDIDATES THAT DO NOT APPLY TO ALL FOUR SITES ARE
LESS LIKELY TO BE INVITED FOR AN INTERVIEW** as preference is given to
applicants who apply to all sites.

# Program Highlights

_**We respectfully acknowledge that the UBC EM Vancouver academic campus is
located on the traditional, ancestral, unceded territory of the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm
(Musqueam), Skwxwú7mesh (Squamish) and səl̓ilwətaɁɬ (Tsleil-Waututh)**_

As the founding site of the UBC Emergency Medicine program, Vancouver has had
a long-standing reputation for graduating strong, competent, and confident
residents who go on to excel in Emergency Medicine across Canada.

  * As Vancouver General Hospital (VGH) is the quaternary referral center for the province, you will work with physicians from Emergency Medicine and other specialties who are nationwide experts in their field. You will also be exposed to complex patients from across the province including the province’s transplant, spinal cord injury, burns cases, addictions, and complex cancer patients.
  * Being based in Vancouver, residents are also able to rotate at other provincial referral centers, including St. Paul’s (province’s referral center for complex cardiac cases), BC Children’s Hospital (province’s referral centre for Pediatrics) and community-based EDs all in the same city.
  * High-fidelity in-situ simulations are held every Tuesday in the trauma bay with nurses and allied health care staff.
  * Our highly-rated Coaching program pairs each resident with a staff physician over the 5 years. This allows for residents to have an academic coach who works with them to enhance their academic growth and supports them through the ups and downs of residency.
  * Dedicated teaching during both Emergency Medicine and off-service rotations from experienced senior residents and supportive staff physicians. 
  * VGH Staff Emergency Physicians often have subspecialty interests of their own and are always happy to share their experiences and expertise.
  * Annual resident retreats and regular staff-resident get-togethers foster a strong community within the program.

**** ****

**Lifestyle**

Vancouver is a world-class city with something to offer everyone – you can
sample any global cuisine your heart desires, purchase artisanal goods from
Granville Island, conquer the famous Grouse Grind hike, and relax at one of
the trendy microbreweries at Olympic Village all in one day! World-class
skiing and mountain biking is easily accessible at Whistler or the North Shore
mountains, and the Pacific Ocean is right on your doorstep with many nearby
beaches.

# Program Curriculum

This residency program is for 5 years.

Program length of training does not exceed the Royal College or College of
Family Physicians of Canada standard.

  * Academic Full Day
    * Academic Full Day occurs every Wednesday – this time is call protected for academic teaching conducted by staff physicians and fellow residents.
    * Many of the sessions are held via videoconference across all 4 sites while some are taught locally at each site.
    * Academic Sessions include:
      * Foundations (PGY-1) and Core (PGY-2-4) seminars – these are based on Rosen’s Emergency Medicine textbook
      * Grand rounds – these include resident and staff presentations in a formal podium style across all sites
      * Patient Safety and Quality Rounds – these include resident led presentations on local cases that were identified as Quality Improvement and system change opportunities.
      * ECG and Radiology teaching sessions – these are typically given by fellow residents in a quiz and case based format.
  * Simulation Training (SIM)
    * UBC has a history of an outstanding simulation program. This was highlighted in our recent accreditation as being a major program strength.
    * Our program has adapted to Competency Based Medical Education with simulation cases targeted to specific Entrustable Professional Activities.
    * Each UBC site runs its own resident simulation program and lab. This allows each group of residents to get individualized and personal attention. There is significant communication and sharing of resources across the sites.  
    * Simulation is an area of educational innovation at UBC with all sites using In-Situ simulation as a basis for ED continuous quality improvement and health care team collaboration. Residents are routinely involved in these rich educational experiences. 
  * Journal Club
    * Journal Club is held monthly at a staff physician’s home -- typically with lots of food to feed the hungry residents after their work days! 
    * There is one session for the Lower Mainland residents, and one each for Kelowna and Victoria
    * Articles are presented and critiqued by residents on a rotating basis with the assistance of a biostatistical expert staff physician.
  * NERD (Novel Education in Research Design)
    * Vancouver serves as the host site for UBC residents from all 4 sites (typically during PGY-2) to gather for this block-length course.
    * **NERD aims to increase resident knowledge about the conduct of various types of research projects as well as the optimal consumption of research findings as a practicing physician. The block also serves to create and improve resident/faculty research collaborations and guide resident scholarly output.   **
    * Residents are provided with guidance to develop their own scholarly projects, explore the diversity of UBC EM research, connect with staff physicians with research expertise, and develop future collaborations.
  * Scholarly Project
    * As mandated by the Royal College, residents "must complete a scholarly research, quality/patient safety or educational project relevant to Emergency Medicine that is documented in a manner that is suitable for submission to a peer reviewed publication or oral presentation at an academic meeting."
    * Residents are given opportunities and support to pursue their own projects or to join with ongoing work by our faculty.
  * Ultrasound Training
    * All PGY-1 UBC residents come to the Vancouver program site in July for an introductory ultrasound course.
    * During PGY-1, there is also a dedicated **ultrasound block held at each program site to achieve** proficiency in simple and advanced ultrasound scanning skills.
  * Practice examinations
    * Residents write the Canadian In Training Exam (CITE) every fall and winter.
    * Results are aggregated across Canada so residents can benchmark their progress with their cohort.
    * Practice oral examinations are held frequently during the year and led by local staff physicians.  Residents participate with increasing frequency as they become more senior.
  * Ethics/Professionalism & Communication Seminar Series
    * Led by an Emergency Physician with training and expertise in medical ethics, these seminars are tailored to resident level of training and take place in a small group discussion format. Topics and cases are reviewed with a focus on ethical issues in clinical medicine as well as professionalism and communication skills.
  * Continuous Quality Improvement Training
    * Residents learn about CQI from emergency physicians with expertise in this area. Seminars and online modules are completed throughout PGY-1 and 2 with specific workshops and projects planned for PGY-5. In addition, residents are involved across the UBC sites in local Patient Safety and Quality case reviews and discussions.
  * Emergency Medicine Specialized Skills
    * Each site delivers hands-on sessions in airway management, casting, slit lamp use, procedures and other relevant skills. These occur throughout the curriculum using expertise across the UBC sites to deliver smaller group practical sessions. The program runs a cadaver procedure lab every two years providing an opportunity to practice high acuity/low occurrence (HALO) procedures such as thoracotomy and surgical airways. 

**Academic Funding**  

To supplement the residents' educational experience during their training at
UBC, each year residents are provided with,

  * Up to $1400 (pro-rated to UBC's fiscal year) from UBC for residents to attend program-wide courses, conferences, purchase educational materials, academic and wellbeing events (such as resident retreats)
  * $500 from their site Emergency Physicians Group for academic related expenses such as textbooks, courses and electronics. 

* * *
