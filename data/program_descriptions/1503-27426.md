# Important Information

The University of Manitoba campuses are located on original lands of
Anishinaabeg, Cree, Oji-Cree, Dakota, and Dene peoples, and on the homeland of
the Métis Nation. The Department of Family Medicine additionally participates
in clinical programs in Inuit communities. We respect the Treaties and
Agreements that were made on these territories, we acknowledge the harms and
mistakes of the past, and we dedicate ourselves to move forward in partnership

**MANDATORY ORIENTATION SESSIONS:**

The mandatory full day **Postgraduate Medical Education Orientation**  for all
residents will be held on Thursday June 26, 2025

The mandatory full day **Family Medicine Residency Orientation  **will be held
on Friday, June 27, 2025



**Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS)**

Prior to the commencement of training, matched applicants must provide proof
of ACLS certification that is current as of July 1, 2024. The ACLS Provider
course must be certified by the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada or the
American Heart Association. ACLS training that is not certified by one of
these two organizations and/or is completed entirely through an online course
will not be accepted. Applicants are responsible for all costs associated with
obtaining ACLS certification. We provide a re-certification course in your
second year of residency prior to graduation.



**Family Medicine Professional Choices (FMProC)**

The Family Medicine Professional Choices (FMProC) testing is mandatory for all
applicants. It is a situational judgement test designed to evaluate your
professional reasoning, communication skills and aptitude for responding
effectively to diverse clinical situations. It primarily consists of two types
of questions: ranking and rating scenarios.

FMProC registration for the first round of CaRMS 2025 will be open on
September 11, 2024. More details: <https://fmproc.com/>

Situational judgement tests are designed to assess applicant’s judgement
regarding situations encountered in the workplace or during training.
Applicants are presented with a set of hypothetical based scenarios and asked
to make judgements about possible responses. Applicants responses are
evaluated against a pre-determined scoring key to provide a picture of their
situational judgement in that particular context.

The development and modification of the scenarios in FMProC involved input
from several leaders with different perspectives, roles and experiences. This
included family physicians, educators, family medicine residents and medical
students, Indigenous health, rural and remote family medicine, 2SLGBTQ+, anti-
racism, international medical graduates and more. This specifically included
groups under-represented in medicine to ensure, as much as possible, that no
group is disadvantaged by the test format or content.

**Resident Home Location and Travel Requirements**

As a resident in the Neepawa stream, you will be expected to maintain a
residence in the Neepawa area.

**Vacation Allowance**

Vacation in PGY1 can be taken in the following ways:

  * Two weeks in each of two blocks in conjunction with an approved elective or Family Medicine Block Time in the remaining two weeks of the same blocks
  * Vacation in 1 week blocks can be taken during Family Medicine Block Time
  * One 4 week vacation block

_*Vacation is not allowed in Block 1 in PGY1.  _

Though the program tries to accommodate residents’ specific vacation period
requests, constraints of scheduling often requires flexibility and not all
requests will be approved.

* * *

# Return of Service

All IMGs will be required to sign a return of service contract with Manitoba
Health, in the specialty (including Family Medicine) in which they have
completed residency training. The ROS commitment is commensurate with the
length of the training program. All IMGs entering a training program already
holding a return of service obligation must disclose this obligation at the
time of application. IMGs who have an undischarged return of service
obligation may not be eligible to begin training in a position funded by
Manitoba Health. Such individuals may wish to contact Shared Health at [pmao-

# Selection Criteria

The Department of Family Medicine at the University of Manitoba is committed
to a fair, equitable, and transparent selection process.

To address the Rady Faculty of Health Sciences commitment to equity, diversity
and inclusion we take proactive measures including implicit bias training for
all selection committees. We strive for diversity and cultural safety
throughout the process (hiring panels, short-list of candidates, interviews).
We encourage you to self-identify any aspect of diversity in your personal
statement.

In assessing eligible IMG applicants, The Department of Family Medicine will
ordinarily consider applicants who have completed their undergraduate medical
education within the preceding 10 years, unless the applicant has completed a
residency in Family Medicine and/or is actively engaged in generalist
practice. Of all such eligible applicants, approximately one third of all
applicants, and no less than 300, shall be selected for file review based upon
a composite score generated from the following:

\- the z-score of MCCQE Part I

\- the better z-score of NAC or the MCCQE Part II

Of those applicants selected for file review, approximately 100-150 applicants
will be selected for interview including all residents of Manitoba, and all
other IMG applicants based upon a composite score generated from the z-score
of MCCQE Part I plus the better z-score of NAC or the MCCQE Part II and file
review score.

Rank order lists will be created for each stream's IMG positions based on the
following formulaic approach:

\- z-score of MCCQE Part I plus the better z-score of NAC or the MCCQE Part II
(20% weighting)

\- file review score (30% weighting)

\- FMProC score (20%)

\- Interview score (30% weighting).

Preference may be given to residents of Manitoba, or individuals who have
identified a genuine commitment to Manitoba.

Applicants who are invited for interview will participate in one structured
interview, regardless of the number of sites to which you have applied. The
structured interview may have questions specific to the sites to which you
have applied.

## Program goals

The University of Manitoba is committed to the social justice principles of
equity, access and participation and to promoting opportunities for
systemically marginalized groups who have been excluded from full
participation at the University and the larger community including Indigenous,
Black, racially marginalized Peoples, persons with disabilities and those who
identify as 2SLGBTQIA+ (Two Spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans,
questioning, intersex, asexual and other diverse sexual identities) and women.

A broad knowledge base and clinical skill sets enable family physicians to
work in diverse settings such as patients' homes, outpatient clinics,
emergency departments, labour and delivery suites, hospital wards, and nursing
homes. Family medicine often serves as the main entry point to the health care
system and the hub that provides continuity of care throughout the life cycle.
As such, family medicine is the central medical discipline. The importance of
primary care in quality of health and the value Canadian society places on
family physicians in the delivery of this care are well known.

The goal of our residency program is to train family physicians who are able
to provide comprehensive, high quality, continuous care in urban, rural, or
remote settings.

## Selection process goals

An inclusive, open and diverse community is essential to excellence and
fosters voices that have been ignored or discouraged. To address the Rady
Faculty of Health Sciences commitment to equity, access and participation, and
in recognition of the underrepresentation of members of historically and
currently excluded groups,  our program has taken the following proactive
measures as part of our selection process:

Implicit bias training for all selection committee members, diverse
representation of selection committee members, inclusion of interview
questions targeted to assess applicant commitment to EDIA, offering necessary
accommodations during the interview process, second pass/review of applicants
below interview and rank order list cut off to review for possible bias in
scoring, orientation to all assessors to scoring rubrics, file review
completed by dedicated, trained group.

We strive for diverse perspectives and cultural safety throughout the hiring
process (resident selection committees, short-list of applicants, interviews).
We ask all applicants to include an EDIA statement in their personal letter
with evidence demonstrating their own commitment to EDIA in their work and
training thus far.

# Program Highlights

# Overview of Department

#### <https://umanitoba.ca/medicine/department-family-medicine>

The University of Manitoba is committed to the social justice principles of
equity, access & participation and to promoting opportunities for systemically
marginalized groups who have been excluded from full participation at the
University and the larger community including Indigenous, Black, racially
marginalized Peoples, persons with disabilities and those who identify as
2SLGBTQIA+ (Two Spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, questioning, intersex,
asexual and other diverse sexual identities) and women.

For more than 40 years, the University of Manitoba’s Department of Family
Medicine has been positively influencing the health of individuals, families
and communities across Manitoba. Through clinical work, teaching and
innovative research, family medicine is making a difference.

We offer residents the chance to learn with interprofessional faculty, such as
dietitians, pharmacists, nurse practitioners and other health care
professionals. This collaborative learning model teaches our students and
residents the basic principles of health care professions, when to use them in
their care of patients and how to make appropriate referrals.

This program, accredited by the College of Family Physicians of Canada,
promotes whole-person medicine through a combination of patient-centred care
and structured seminars. During clerkship, learners are distributed in over 20
communities throughout Manitoba.

Family Medicine is a wide-ranging discipline, with the chance to impact a
diverse spectrum of patients in various communities. Manitoba is one of the
most diverse provinces in the country, providing an excellent opportunity to
work with patients from a variety of backgrounds.

  

## Training Passionate Family Physicians

After completing a four-year undergraduate degree in Medicine, students who
enter the two-year Family Medicine residency choose a learning stream tailored
to their practice interests.

Here is a video with a general overview of our Family Medicine Program at the

# Program Curriculum

This residency program is for 2 years.

Program length of training does not exceed the Royal College or College of
Family Physicians of Canada standard.

We care very much about the health of our community. We also care very much
about upholding the reputation of Canadian-trained rural family doctors. As
such, expect this residency to challenge you with high standards. You can also
expect a supportive environment to help you achieve those standards.

You will be paired with a primary preceptor throughout your two years. You
will develop your own cohort of patients to offer them (and you) the benefit
of continuity of care. You will also continue to see patients outside of that
cohort to maximize your exposure to various conditions and to undifferentiated
presentations.

Family Medicine Block time will incorporate longitudinal experiences in the ER
(at least 1 shift per week), obstetrics (expect to be involved in at least one
delivery per week), and anesthesia. Longitudinal experiences can be further
tailored according to your learning objectives (PCH, oncology, more
ER/Obs/anesthesia, etc). In addition to giving you additional clinical
exposures, these longitudinal experiences will allow you work with other
physicians in the group.

Specialty rotations in Brandon and Winnipeg will be used to supplement Family
Medicine Block Time. These rotations have been thoughtfully chosen to balance
acuity, relevance to rural family medicine, and hands-on
experience/responsibility:



  Internal Medicine - 8 weeks (Winnipeg)

  General Surgery - 4 weeks (Brandon)

  Orthopedic Surgery - 2 weeks (Brandon, mostly in cast clinic)

  Plastic Surgery - 2 weeks (Winnipeg)

  ER - 4 weeks Brandon or Winnipeg

  Peds ER - 4 weeks Winnipeg

  ICU - 4 weeks Brandon

  Pediatrics - 4 weeks Inpatient Winnipeg

  Obs/Gyne - 8 weeks Brandon

  Palliative Care - 4 weeks Winnipeg

  Electives - 12 weeks (4 of which can be family medicine block time if
preferred)

  Vacation - 8 weeks



Accommodations for out of town rotations will be provided by the University.



We will team up with larger residency programs in nearby Dauphin, Brandon, or
Portage la Prairie for academic days and social activities.

# Training Sites

Welcome to Neepawa!

Neepawa has a decades-long tradition of medical education. Our dedication to
teaching is reflected in the positive evaluations we receive, teaching awards,
and the student apartments we have put into the basement of our clinic. After
teaching visiting residents for many years, we are thrilled to have started
our own residency program last year.  We are committed to ensuring our
residents get the best training possible.

The Beautiful Plains Community Medical Clinic will be the host clinic for
Family Medicine Block Time. We are a collegial group of eitght fee-for-service
physicians ranging from 1 to nearly 30 years of family medicine experience.
Each of us has a family practice, work in the ER, and has an inpatient load.
About half of us practice obstetrics, delivering between 100 and 150 babies
per year. Among the group we have a Family Practice Anesthetist, an Enhanced
Surgical Skills, an Obstetrical Surgical Skills, and two GP Oncologists. Two
of us cover the Personal Care Home. Itinerant specialists include two ENT
Surgeons, a General Surgeon, a General Internist, and a Neurologist. We also
all have families, with children ranging from infants to vascular surgery
residents!

Our small size is our biggest strength. There is a definite family feel to our
group as we work as a team to provide excellent care to our community. Our
small size also gives us the freedom to tailor your experience to your
educational objectives. Any of the attendings will be happy to find you for an
interesting case or procedure; something you can expect to happen almost
daily.

You need not worry that our small size will hamper your exposure or clinical
volumes. We have excellent support from the University of Manitoba, and from
larger residency sites in nearby Dauphin, Brandon, and Portage La Prairie. You
will team up with them for some specialty rotations, and join them for
academic days and social activities. Moreover, longitudinal exposures to the
emergency room, operating room, anesthesia, and obstetrics will work in
concert with your dedicated specialty rotations giving you the experience you
need to practice full-scope family medicine anywhere in Canada.

Another benefit of our site is our patient population.  They are grateful,
welcoming, generous, and happy to have learners involved in their care.  We
have found that this goes a long way to preventing burnout and motivating us
to provide the best care possible.  You will likely want to join our community
gym to fend off the endless supply of baking and garden produce from our
grateful patients!

We look forward to welcoming you to our family!

# Additional Information

Neepawa is town of approximately 5500 people. With Winnipeg 2 hours East, and
Brandon only 45 minutes away, we have the perks of rural medicine and a rural
lifestyle, with urban amenities and specialist support close at hand. Just
over half of our population is Filipino, with the HyLife Hog plant attracting
many immigrants. The Filipino culture is a welcome and colourful addition to
our farming community.

This immigration has helped make Neepawa one of the fastest growing
communities in Manitoba. It's fun to be part of a growing community: a new
hospital is being built; our middle school is only 3 years old, and
construction on a new high school will break ground soon. Also exciting is the
planning of an active living trail through town. Construction has recently
begun on a new hotel and spa/retreat centre. The Back 40 is a mountain bike
park in town that is a couple years old and continues to have new features
built. It feels like every day a new opportunity opens for child or adult
recreation.

Camping, fishing, hunting, and all kinds of outdoors opportunities abound.
Riding Mountain National Park is only 45minutes away. Spruce Woods Provincial
Park is about 45 minutes in the other direction. Both offer plentiful
opportunities for hiking, skiing, snowshoeing, biking, and camping. There are
also many trails and lakes within a few minutes of town. Minnedosa, only 20
minutes down the road, has a great downhill ski hill for beginners and
children. Asessippi, a bigger downhill ski resort with respectable downhill
bike courses in the summer, is 90 minutes west.

The Arts are also well-represented in Neepawa. There are music festivals, art
exhibits, concert series, and plays. Classes are available in all of these
genres through the ArtsForward organization in town.

For those interested in history, the Margaret Lawrence House and the Beautiful
Plains Museum will be of interest.

Kids opportunities abound: Rec hockey, minor hockey, figure skating, cross-
country ski club, gymnastics, baseball/softball, swim club, 4H club, Kids of
Mud bike club, Air Cadets, music lessons, art lessons, dance, and much more.

Adults also have access to a plethora of activities: Neepawa Titans hockey
team (MJHL), an active gym/fitness club, basketball, spin club, boxing, a
gorgeous 18 hole golf course, movie theatre, performing arts, visual arts,
several active churches, and many volunteer opportunities. We have a paved
airstrip, and crop dusters are a common sight.

With just about every industry represented in town, finding work for a spouse
should be easy.

In short, it will be impossible to experience everything Neepawa has to offer
in a two-year residency, and you might well want to settle here long term. You
would be welcomed with open arms!
