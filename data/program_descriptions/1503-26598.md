# Important Information

**All candidates must meet the Ontario Criteria of Eligibility**  found
[here](http://www.carms.ca/en/residency/r-1/eligibility-criteria/provincial-
criteria/ontario/).

**COVID-19 vaccination**

Please be aware that most, if not all, hospitals in Ontario have mandatory
COVID-19 vaccination policies in place that require, in the absence of a valid
medical or human rights exemption, proof of vaccination. Acceptable
vaccination must be in accordance with Health Canada. You will be required to
provide an attestation that you meet this requirement as part of the CaRMS
application process and any actual documentation will be collected by the
appropriate institution if matched. These guidelines could change at any time
in accordance with future direction from the Ministry of Health or the
Universities based on information from Public Health.

**MCCQE (Medical Council of Canada qualifying examination) Part 1 results** :

Trainees will be required to disclose their MCCQE Part 1 examination results
**if taken** , upon entry into any of the University of Ottawa's training
programs. **Please note that the MCCQE Part 1 is  not a requirement to begin
residency.** The purpose of this disclosure is to allow for resources to be
provided to the few residents who would benefit from extra support early in
their residency in an effort to maximize their success.

**Failure to meet or provide proof of any of the stated requirements may
result in an applicant’s file not being reviewed or removed from the Rank
Order List.**

**Licensing/Registration:   **Must have documents verified through
physiciansapply.ca

**Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada:  Applying competency-
based practices to residency education**

To contribute to the success of Canadian physicians and the delivery of high-
quality patient care, the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada
has embarked upon an initiative to introduce competency-based medical
education (CBME) in Canadian postgraduate specialty training and in
professional practice in Canada.  This initiative, called Competence by Design
(CBD), aims to enhance patient care by aligning medical education and lifelong
learning with evolving patient needs and empowering learners to more fully
engage in their education process.

The residency program curriculum will be divided into stages, and each stage
will have a series of Entrustable Professional Activities (EPA's)  based on
required competencies.  These EPA's will create more targeted learning
outcomes and involve more frequent, formative assessments within the clinical
workplace to ensure residents are developing and receiving feedback on all the
skills they need.

All programs implementing CBD will continue to undergo the same rigorous
accreditation processes as traditional programs.  Certification for trainees
will include the completion of a Royal College examination; however, residents
in CBD programs will also be assessed against stage specific EPA's throughout
their training.  Within our CBD program, all EPA's are documented within an
electronic portfolio.  Successful completion of all EPA's and the Royal
College exam must be successfully completed to achieve certification.

For more information, please contact cbd@royalcollege.ca

# Program Highlights

We are the Department of Anesthesia and Pain Medicine at the University of
Ottawa. Our residency program prides itself in being national leaders in
Anesthesia education. We offer flexibility and accessibility by being small
enough to individualize each resident's experience while also being large
enough to offer a full range of anesthesia and tertiary care experiences. The
department has many enthusiastic teachers on staff who are committed to
resident education. The 135 faculty members in Ottawa provide a wide breadth
of clinical skill and research experience. We foster a close support
relationship between faculty and residents through our social activities and a
formal mentorship program.

A particular strength of the Ottawa program results from being pioneers in
Competency Based Medical Education. Our national leaders in specialty training
include regional anesthesia, pediatric anesthesia, cardiac anesthesia and Pain
Medicine. Our simulation program is a national leader in innovative programs
to support residents training in Crisis Management and managing rare events.
We have a newly accredited Pain Medicine Residency Program and are the first
center in Canada to have a formal perioperative echocardiography program. Our
research agenda focuses on enhancing perioperative care, pain management and
medical education.

The program meets or exceeds all of the Royal College of Physicians and
Surgeons of Canada specialty training requirements. Our program successfully
underwent full accreditation in May 2024. Our program includes an
internationally recognized model Pre- Admission Unit, a Hyperbaric Oxygen
Therapy Unit and a multidisciplinary Chronic Pain Clinic. One of the unique
assets of our Anesthesia Program is local access to the headquarters of the
Royal College of Physician and Surgeons with multiple faculty that have
affiliations with the Royal College as examiners or in other roles.

# Program Curriculum

This residency program is for 5 years.

Program length of training does not exceed the Royal College or College of
Family Physicians of Canada standard.

This residency program curriculum is 5 years in duration, the Royal College or
College of Family Physicians of Canada standard. In July 2015, our training
program was the very first to launch a competency-based curriculum. In keeping
with the Royal College's overall CBD mandate, there will be a strong focus on
ensuring residents successfully demonstrate competencies within the defined
entrustable professional activities (EPA's) and milestones as defined by the
national curriculum of Royal College.

The CBD program is structured according to the Royal College template for all
specialties and includes four stages: Transition to Discipline, Foundations,
Core and Transition to Practice. In our new innovative program, we give our
residents a head start into their Anesthesia training by providing an
intensive Anesthesia Bootcamp early on in their Foundations block with a heavy
focus on simulation. We hope the intensive training early on will ensure our
residents are confident and able to meet the demands of clinical care.

**Stages:  **

Transition to Discipline is 1 block in duration and consists of general
orientation and exposure to the operating rooms, acute pain service and pre-
admission unit.

Foundations stage is 24 blocks in duration. The initial blocks are "boot camp"
style, during this time, residents will acquire basic anesthesia knowledge and
skills that will allow them to successfully make the transition to the
clinical realm and to solo call responsibilities. The boot camp period
includes a significant amount of simulation, academic sessions, hands-on
workshops and case studies, in addition to ACLS and ATLS courses. During the
following blocks of foundations, the residents will practice their skills in
the general OR setting, the Pre-Anesthesia Unit (PAU), experience with the
Acute Pain Service, Trauma, ICU, Emergency, Pediatric ER

Ambulatory Anesthesia, Respirology, Cardiology and the Obstetrical unit.
Residents also get a transitioned exposure to anesthesia call as they shadow a
more senior anesthesia resident for the first 6 blocks of training.

Core stage is the mainstay of our curriculum where residents will complete
sub-specialty modules in such areas as: Chronic pain, vascular anesthesia,
regional anesthesia, obstetrical anesthesia, thoracic anesthesia, neuro
anesthesia and cardiac anesthesia. Operating room experiences in each of these
areas are supplemented by learner centered on-line case based modules and
other e-Learning strategies. Core is divided into a spiral-based curriculum
wherein the residents are able to complete both a junior and senior rotation
within major sub-specialties.

Transition to Practice stage is planned for 9 months at the end of residency.
It allows residents to practice in a more independent fashion as they prepare
to move on to practice as consultant anesthesiologists. Emphasis will be
placed on increasingly independent work and career planning - creating
physicians who are truly ready for independent practice.

**Simulation:**  

The University of Ottawa Skills and Simulation Center is one of the largest
and most comprehensive simulation centers in North America. We play a pivotal
role in new developments in areas of innovative program and curricula
development. We offer the most extensive Simulation curriculum in Canada. Our
Anesthesia Bootcamp runs for three months in the first year of residency and
provides access to high and low fidelity simulation 1 day per week. Within the
Core years of residency each resident attends a minimum of two simulation
sessions per year. There are additional simulation experiences provided
outside the simulation centre via crisis management courses, team based
sessions, workshops, bootcamps and medical education related research
involvement. Our own faculty Dr. Michelle Chiu, is the Chair of the committee
to initiate and develop a Canadian National Anesthesia Simulation Curriculum
(CanNASC)  



**Resources:**  

We have state of the art anesthetic machines in all our OR's (Adult GE-Aisys
CS2; Pediatric Draeger Zeus). Since June 2019, we have moved to the EPIC
electronic records management system to help provide world class care to our
patients. Access to the EPIC Electronic Medical Record (EMR) can be obtained
through an iPAD or a personal computer. Residents receive financial support
through the Department of Anesthesia to attend the annual CAS meeting, LUCAS
conference, present research papers at National Conferences, and are also
fully supported to complete ACLS, ATLS and NRP certifications.



**Program Evaluation:**  

The glue of our program is the Residency Program Committee (RPC) and Clinical
Competency Committee (CCC). These committees meet regularly throughout the
year to discuss all sites, rotations, and specific resident issues. Members of
this committee include the Program Director, Vice Chair of Education, Resident
Coordinators from the University of Ottawa Heart Institute, TOH General and
Civic Campuses, CHEO, chief residents and elected resident representative. We
have several ad hoc members covering the realm of education research,
simulation, family practice-anesthesia and undergraduate anesthesia. In order
to ensure that resident concerns and feedback are heard, not only are there
regular updates from RPC reps but we also have an annual program survey
(anonymous), bi-annual All Resident Meetings and a yearly meeting with the
Program Director.

The resident coordinators at all sites conduct regular face-to-face exit
interview with each resident at the conclusion of each stage and module, and
every resident meets with their assigned Faculty Academic Coach bi-annually,
together they track all performance data which gets submitted to the
Competence Committee.

The Anesthesia Program at the university of Ottawa has a solid accreditation
record with many strengths and no major weaknesses identified at the last
accreditation visit. Our end of year University of Ottawa program survey
reflects strengths in every aspect of our program: Leadership, curriculum,
resident well-being, collegiality, professional development and career
guidance. Also, the success rates on the Royal College Examinations remain
higher than national average with a 100% pass rate on the first attempt for
our Canadian Medical Graduates over the past many years.

**Enrichment Training Pathway:**  The enrichment pathway within the University
of Ottawa Anesthesiology Residency Program is designed to allow residents the
flexibility to seek out further professional opportunities or deviate from the
standard curriculum while still achieving the residency program requirements
set out by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. Residents
must meet the criteria outlined to be accepted into the pathway with the
guiding principle that residents must demonstrate capacity to fulfill BOTH
their residency program requirements AND those of their enrichment pathway
prior to acceptance.

This program was created to support residents who have educational endeavors
outside of the formal anesthesiology curriculum, and who have also
demonstrated that they will be able to accomplish these endeavors through a
strong academic and professional portfolio. This is an OPTIONAL program.



**The City:**

Ottawa, as the Nation's capital, has many excellent cultural activities -
theatre, orchestra, restaurants, museums, art galleries, etc. Annual festivals
include the Jazz festival, Blues festival, Folk festival, Winterlude to name
but a few! Access to outdoor opportunities abound -skating on the Rideau
canal, cross-country skiing, hiking or mountain biking in the Gatineau hills
is minutes away. World class downhill skiing a Mont Tremblant is 2 hours away,
other good ski slopes are within a 1-hour drive from downtown. We're central
and proximal to many other major cities such as Montreal (2 hours), Toronto (4
hours) and New York City (6 hours) which make perfect weekend getaways after a
busy week.
