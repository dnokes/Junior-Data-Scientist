# Program Highlights

**Yellowknife**

We are a rural and remote Family Medicine training stream within the
Department of Family Medicine at the University of Alberta.  We believe the
Northwest Territories (NWT) is a perfect location to train family physicians
to be practice-ready for any community in Canada!  We are proud to be Canada's
only full-time residency program based out of a circumpolar region.

The Yellowknife site prides itself on the emphasis we place on resident
wellbeing and the support we provide to our residents. As a small program,
Yellowknife residents develop close, supportive relationships with their
fellow residents, as well as with preceptors and administrative staff.

Residents will be part of an integrated primary care team based out of
Yellowknife and will complete rotations throughout the NWT, Nunavut, Alberta,
and travel clinics in smaller, remote communities of the NWT. Residents will
have the opportunity to practice urban, rural, and remote medicine that will
further their dedication to Indigenous health by working with and learning
from the diverse Dene, Inuit, and Métis populations of the NWT.  

If you're looking to become a well-rounded family physician with a strong
skill set to practice full-scope Family Medicine in urban, rural, and remote
areas that will allow you to work in any centre in Canada; then this program
will meet and exceed your expectations!  Come live and experience life North
of 60.



**Resident Wellbeing & Support**

Although extremely rewarding, we recognize that residency training is a very
demanding and potentially stressful experience. In addition, we recognize that
residents have lives outside of medicine which can also be the source of
unexpected stressors.

When residents are faced with challenging situations and find themselves in
need of support, they have a great variety of resources to call upon. Often,
they feel comfortable approaching a fellow resident, the Site Administrator
(April Lau), or one of the Site Directors. If further assistance is required,
the University of Alberta has a dedicated Assistant Program Director in charge
of Resident Support. Residents who have required a special leave of absence
have found the program to be extremely accommodating.

* * *

# Program Curriculum

This residency program is for 2 years.

Program length of training does not exceed the Royal College or College of
Family Physicians of Canada standard.

You may notice that eight (8)  weeks of elective time are available in the
first year of residency. Over the last few years, we have looked at some new
and exciting electives that would enhance your residency experience.

For this cohort of residents, we are piloting Trauma medicine as a CORE
rotation in PGY-2. In order to accommodate that, we have moved all elective
weeks into the PGY-1 year. As we have a small program, we will pivot and make
changes as needed to ensure our residents get the best residency experience
possible.

Interprovincial electives are available with permission from the Residency
Program Committee.

**First Year**

The first 16 weeks of the residency program will be spent in an integrated
family medicine block where the resident will have a mixture of clinic days
with their Faculty Advisor (and other preceptors) along with obstetrics,
emergency medicine, and hospitalist weeks doing inpatient medicine.  
The first 16 weeks will also be spent learning about the NWT through dedicated
Cultural training days and meeting with elders and leaders in the resident’s
linked communities.

In addition to the Integrated Family Medicine block time, residents will spend
8 weeks on a Family Medicine Community block in Iqaluit, Nunavut.  There,
residents will do a mixture of clinic and rural emergency medicine. Our
residents will also take part in remote travel clinics, typically spending
one-week doing clinic in a remote Arctic community of 500-3000 people.

The remainder of the first year consists of four specialty rotations in
Yellowknife and one specialty rotation in Edmonton.  The rotations have been
designed to facilitate exposure to a wide variety of acute conditions and to
the acquisition of procedural skills.  Specialty rotations in Edmonton may
occasionally be shared with specialty residents from Calgary or Edmonton.  
One-on-one time with preceptors provides the resident with plenty of exposure
to clinical cases and individualized teaching**.  
**

**Second Year**

The main focus of the second year is on the integrated 20-week Family Medicine
Blocks with outpatient Psychiatry, Orthopedics/Sports Medicine, and Addictions
while regularly visiting the linked small communities, and providing
continuity of care in the clinics.  

Another 8 weeks will be spent in Canada’s most northern hospital in the
community of Inuvik. On these Family Medicine Community Blocks, residents will
do a mix of primary care clinic, emergency medicine,  obstetrics, and travel
clinics to remote communities.  These family medicine blocks are designed to
further develop the resident as a rural family medicine physician, building on
the skills acquired from the first year. These rotations provide further
opportunities to experience comprehensive medicine and continuity of care in
rural and remote settings.

The remainder of the year will consist of specialty rotations in Edmonton and
Yellowknife focusing on Trauma Medicine, Intensive Care, Geriatrics,
Palliative Care, Women’s Health, and Emergency Medicine.

**Academics**

Academic days are made up of didactic teaching and interactive sessions,
including exam preparation, therapeutics, ethics, and guideline review.
Regular workshops are scheduled each year with all the U of A rural residents.
These workshops are a great way for all rural residents to stay connected
during residency. Workshop subjects include Evidence-Based Medicine,
Behavioural Medicine, CASTED, PoCUS Ultrasound training, and ongoing bedside
training to gain independent practitioner status at the time of graduation.

**Life Support Courses**

Residents must be ACLS certified before starting the residency program. ALARM,
ATLS, NRP, and PALS courses are all provided to (or reimbursed to the
resident) when successfully completed during residency.

**Research  **

In the first year, each resident does a workshop in Evidence-Based Medicine
(EBM) and then throughout the year, utilizes these skills to complete four
small EBM research projects to answer clinical questions they have
encountered.  These take no more than a day to complete.

A Practice Quality Improvement (PQI) project is assigned in the second year
and is completed in the 20-week family medicine block. Residents are expected
to present their PQI to the practice group in which they completed the
project. Funding may be available to support the presentation of resident
projects at family medicine conferences and meetings, and research assistance
is accessible through the Department of Family Medicine and Alberta Primary
Care Research Unit.

**Summary**

If you're looking to become a well-rounded family physician with a strong
skill set to practice full-scope family medicine in urban, rural, and remote
areas that will allow you to work in any centre in Canada; then this program
will meet and exceed your expectations!  Come live and experience life North
of 60.

# Training Sites

**Yellowknife**

The program will be a mixture of integrated and blocked learning. Our
interdisciplinary model of medicine in the NWT will have residents interact
with specialist physicians and other health care professionals on a weekly,
sometimes daily, basis throughout their two years here. Yellowknife, the
capital city of the NWT, has a population of 21,000 and is located on the
north shore of Great Slave Lake. Yellowknife is a vibrant, multicultural,
artistic, and welcoming city that hosts numerous festivals and events
throughout the year. Outdoor enthusiasts will love the easy access to the
wilderness in every season. Yellowknife also has great indoor sports
facilities and clubs to ensure you stay active all year long.

In Yellowknife, the Stanton Territorial Hospital is the referral hospital for
all of the NWT and the western third of Nunavut, has a vast geographic
catchment area (nearly 18% of Canada's landmass) and encompasses a
heterogeneous population with complex health, and psychosocial needs.

The program will fund travel expenses and accommodations for community
rotations and mandatory activities. While on mandatory rotations away from
Yellowknife, accommodations will be provided; this could be an apartment,
condo, or a house.  Most accommodations will be large enough for 2 people and
many are suitable for families. However, in the small community sites, we take
advantage of sleeping quarters at the health centre or bed and breakfasts
which are ideal for single occupancy.  

Residents are responsible for their own housing in Yellowknife. To offset the
slightly higher cost of living in the NWT, residents will be paid a monthly
Northern Living Allowance during their residency (automatically added to
payroll).

**Rural & Remote Sites**

Besides Yellowknife, residents will also train in Iqaluit, Inuvik, and
Alberta. Residents will also be linked to smaller and more remote NWT
communities to provide ongoing clinical care in those communities throughout
your residency. Some of these smaller communities are fly-in or winter road
access only!

Iqaluit is Nunavut’s capital with a population nearing 8,000. Residents will
be based out of the Qikiqtani General Hospital which serves the Qikiqtani
(Baffin) Region and the people of Nunavut. There are no roads connecting the
communities of Nunavut so daily flight services are essential.  
  
This site also takes learners from the MUN NunaFam Program, University of
Ottawa Pediatrics, and others for electives.  There is much to do outside the
hospital as well, including land trips, nordic skiing, a community aquatic
center, and many music and arts-based activities.

Inuvik, NT is located north of the Arctic Circle in the heart of the Mackenzie
Delta. The Inuvik Regional Hospital is the northernmost hospital in Canada!
With its tight-knit and welcoming physician group, Inuvik has been welcoming
medical learners (students and residents) for nearly 20 years and is well
placed to provide an exceptional Family Medicine residency experience.
Residents will participate in travel clinics to the surrounding areas, and
into the High Arctic!

* * *

# Additional Information

**Travel Requirements**

It is expected that residents in the Rural programs utilize their own
transport when traveling to and from teaching sites, within Yellowknife, and
for rotations outside of Yellowknife. A current driver's license and access to
a vehicle are mandatory in the U of A Rural Residency Program due to the
distances between teaching sites.

**Rural residents will also be required to attend several**mandatory**
academic workshops during residency. These workshops are held in numerous
locations in Alberta and the Northwest Territories and can be up to a week in
length. Travel and accommodations costs are provided or reimbursed by the
program for the resident only.**

**CaRMS Self-Identification Questionnaire (CSIQ)**

The University of Alberta recognizes the importance of diversity, equity,
inclusivity, decolonization, and indigenization (EDIDI) and is committed to
the Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry’s policy on anti-racism.

Further, the University is committed to implementing the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission calls to action that are relevant to education and
medicine.The pursuit of diversity and equitable opportunities is a core value
that guides our selection practices.

The University encourages applications from underrepresented groups, including
Indigenous persons, persons with a disability, racialized persons, women,
persons of a minority gender identity or sexual orientation, and individuals
who would contribute to the diversity of the medical community. The CaRMS
Self-Identification Questionnaire (CSIQ) is an optional form that candidates
can fill out.

Our program recognizes the importance of EDIDI and anti-racism in residency
selection. We invite applicants to optionally complete and include the CSIQ to
assist our understanding of the diversity of applicant pools, but the CSIQ is
not currently utilized as part of our application or selection process. We are
using other methods to ensure mitigation of bias and equitable opportunities
for all applicants.
