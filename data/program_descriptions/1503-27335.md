# Important Information

**All candidates must meet the Ontario Criteria of Eligibility**  found
[here](http://www.carms.ca/en/residency/r-1/eligibility-criteria/provincial-
criteria/ontario/).

**COVID-19 vaccination**

Please be aware that most, if not all, hospitals in Ontario have mandatory
COVID-19 vaccination policies in place that require, in the absence of a valid
medical or human rights exemption, proof of vaccination. Acceptable
vaccination must be in accordance with Health Canada. You will be required to
provide an attestation that you meet this requirement as part of the CaRMS
application process and any actual documentation will be collected by the
appropriate institution if matched. These guidelines could change at any time
in accordance with future direction from the Ministry of Health or the
Universities based on information from Public Health.

**MCCQE (Medical Council of Canada qualifying examination) Part 1 results** :

Trainees will be required to disclose their MCCQE Part 1 examination results
if taken, upon entry into any of the University of Ottawa's training programs.
**Please note that the MCCQE Part 1 is  not a requirement to begin
residency.** The purpose of this disclosure is to allow for resources to be
provided to the few residents who would benefit from extra support early in
their residency in an effort to maximize their success.

**CBD (Competence by Design)**

Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada: Applying competency-based
practices to residency education

To contribute to the success of Canadian physicians and the delivery of high-
quality patient care, the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada
has embarked upon an initiative to introduce competency-based medical
education (CBME) in Canadian postgraduate specialty training and in
professional practice in Canada. This initiative, called [Competence by Design
(CBD)](http://www.royalcollege.ca/rcsite/competence-design-e), aims to enhance
patient care by aligning medical education and lifelong learning with evolving
patient needs and empowering learners to more fully engage in their education
process.

CBD will use [time as a
framework](http://www.royalcollege.ca/rcsite/cbd/competence-by-design-cbd-e)
rather than the basis for progression. It is not anticipated that the duration
of training will change for the majority of trainees. Residency programs will
be broken down into
[stages](http://www.royalcollege.ca/rcsite/documents/cbd/cbd-competence-
continuum-diagram-legal-e.pdf), and each stage will have a series of
milestones based on required competencies. These milestones will create more
targeted learning outcomes and involve more frequent, formative assessments
within the clinical workplace to ensure residents are developing and receiving
feedback on the skills they need.

All programs implementing CBD will continue to undergo the same rigorous
accreditation processes as traditional programs. All CBD programs (and
traditional programs) will continue to lead to Royal College approved
certification. Certification for trainees in both CBD and traditional programs
will include the completion of a Royal College examination; however, residents
in CBD programs will also be assessed against program milestones throughout
their training. Within a CBD program, all milestones (documented within an
electronic portfolio) and the Royal College examination must be successfully
completed to achieve certification.

For more information, please contact
[cbd@royalcollege.ca](mailto:cbd@royalcollege.ca).

**Failure to meet or provide proof of any of the stated requirements may
result in an applicant’s file not being reviewed or removed from the Rank
Order List.**

# Program Curriculum

This residency program is for 5 years.

Program length of training does not exceed the Royal College or College of
Family Physicians of Canada standard.

The University of Ottawa training program in Otolaryngology-Head & Neck
Surgery is a five-year residency program. The program is fully accredited by
the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada and has been in
existence for over 25 years.

This Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery program at the University of Ottawa
consists of 1 year of Surgical Foundations training followed by 4 years of
specialty training at the University of Ottawa teaching hospitals.

The program’s first year consists of introductory rotations in Otolar

yngology-Head & Neck Surgery. During this initial year, residents rotate at
all of our Departmental sites. This allows residents to become familiar with
all team members and faculty. Our PGY1s complete 10 off service blocks in
surgical and nonsurgical disciplines related to our specialty and another 3 in
ENT. These rotations comply with the guidelines of the subspecialty committee
in Otolaryngology-Head &Neck Surgery at the Royal College of Physicians and
Surgeons of Canada. These specialties include ICU, General Surgery, Pediatric
Surgery, Plastic Surgery, Neurosurgery, Anesthesiology, Thoracic, Emergency,
and recently added Palliative Care.

The 2nd year is fully on service with ENT, except for one senior rotation in
the ICU. This off service rotation allows the residents to develop independent
skills in managing sick patients as they must act as the senior call resident
for their unit. The remainder of PGY2 includes rotations at all major teaching
hospitals in the role of the junior ENT resident. The goal of the year is to
allow each resident to develop their basic knowledge and skills relating to
the specialty, including early operative exposure.

The 3rd year is marked by the beginning of subspecialty ENT rotations. During
this year, the residents also participate in a community rotation in the
location of their choosing. This allows our residents to see the full
potential of community practice in Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery in
Canada. The residents also participate in their first elective rotation.

In the 4th year, residents rotate in all otolaryngology subspecialties within
the University of Ottawa system. They gain a significant amount of surgical
independence throughout this year. The residents also have two more elective
rotations within the specialty. The 4th year is also marked as the year
residents take on the responsibilities of Chief resident. Near the end of the
fourth year of training, residents are removed from the nighttime call
schedule to allow them to have increased Royal College exam study time and
will resume call duties after their exam.

In the final year of residency training, the residents have three months of
training in Head & Neck Oncology, Rhinology and Otology-Neurotology and one
month in Facial Plastic surgery and pediatric otolaryngology. The Resident
will attend a half-day biweekly longitudinal clinic, where they act as MRP
(most responsible physician) for their patient cohort. This will allow the
trainee to have exposure to and experience of running a continuity clinic,
with a greater opportunity for follow-up of patients seen in initial
consultation.



University of Ottawa Otolaryngology residents train in two major academic
health science centers affiliated with the University of Ottawa. The Ottawa
Hospital is one of Canada's biggest academic health science centers, and all
adult patients are seen at one of two main campuses: the General campus and
the Civic campus. The residents also go to the Riverside campus, in which
daycare procedures are performed. The pediatric teaching center is the
Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO). All aspects of pediatric care
in Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery are performed at this site. During their
residency, residents will spend most of their time in one of the Ottawa
Hospital campuses and 8 months at CHEO. In addition, some rotations involve
days in the OR at various local community hospitals.

The residency program's academic program consists of a three-year spiral
subspecialty curriculum that covers all aspects of training in Otolaryngology-
Head & Neck Surgery. The academic half-day is on Friday afternoons, and the
sessions are faculty driven. Block examinations also highlight the program to
help residents assess their progress in knowledge acquisition and multiple
sessions on non-medical expert topics of importance to residents in
Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery. Half day time also includes local surgical
simulations/courses, annual practice oral examinations, protected research
time, among other academic activities.

Research is also a significant portion of the residency program. Up to three
blocks of research time is offered to all residents to enable them to
participate and complete projects. All projects are completed with guidance
from a departmental faculty member. Stipends are given to all residents for
presentations of projects at meetings.

Residents in the program participate in various outreach programs. The Nunavut
outreach program is a Departmental initiative in which services are offered to
the residents of Nunavut. Four annual trips to Iqaluit are planned. A resident
and 1-2 faculty members travel to Iqaluit for one week to treat patients
suffering from issues relating to the specialty. Finally, the department
conducts an annual head and neck cancer screening day at Ottawa homeless
shelters. Otolaryngology residents and staff travel to the shelters to perform
screening head and neck physical exams for this high-risk population with low
access to healthcare.

# Training Sites

The training is carried out in four teaching hospitals:

  * Ottawa Hospital - Civic Campus 

  * Ottawa Hospital - General Campus

  * Ottawa Hospital - Riverside Campus

  * Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario  

Time is also spent in the ORs of various local community hospitals with our
community ENT faculty members
