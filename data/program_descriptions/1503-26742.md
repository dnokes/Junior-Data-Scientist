# Program Highlights

The Division of Vascular Surgery at the University of Ottawa boasts a long
history of excellence in training vascular surgeons and is recognized as one
of Canada’s earliest vascular surgery programs. Our 5-year program is
meticulously designed to meet and exceed Royal College standards, producing
successful graduates who are now practicing across Canada, USA, Kuwait, Oman,
UAE and Saudi Arabia.

Since consolidating vascular surgery at the Civic Campus in 2000, our program
benefits from one of the largest institutional volumes of clinical vascular
surgery in Canada. Serving a catchment area of 1.25 to 1.5 million people, we
provide extensive clinical experience in both open and endovascular
procedures. Despite the demanding workload, we ensure a balanced approach to
education and personal life, supported by additional staff and resources.

Currently, our program hosts 7 residents. Most join via direct CaRMS entry,
with occasional placements for those coming from general surgery into a 2-year
fellowship stream. Since adopting the Competency by Design (CBD) curriculum in
2021, we offer a comprehensive training experience- in addition to a simple,
complex and advanced open vascular and endovascular surgical procedures, our
residency training program includes exposure to cardiac, general, thoracic,
and plastic surgery, critical care, interventional radiology, stroke
neurology, amputation rehabilitation, ID, and wound care. The curriculum
emphasizes early exposure and independence, preparing residents for
independent surgical practice. Our educational framework includes weekly
‘Difficult Case Rounds, Wednesday morning rounds, and dedicated academic half-
days featuring chapter readings, quizzes, and technical skills sessions.

Several of our surgeons have completed fellowships in minimally invasive
Endovascular Surgery. This expertise allows us to offer a balanced training
curriculum in both open and endovascular procedures. In addition, our program
enjoys a cooperative relationship with Interventional Radiology. The
collaborative environment enhances endovascular skills through a two-month
rotation in the angio-suite.

The Vascular Diagnostic Laboratory at the Ottawa Hospital’s Civic Campus,
accredited by the Intersocietal Commission for the Accreditation of Vascular
Laboratories (ICAVL), performs high-quality non-invasive vascular
investigations daily. Residents benefit from rotations in the lab, gaining
proficiency in diagnostic procedures and their interpretation.

Research is a priority within our division. We employ a full-time research
coordinator nurse to assist residents with their projects. Our faculty
includes three members with Masters of Epidemiology, providing excellent
supervision for research and thesis projects. Residents can take ‘research
blocks’ to focus on research or coursework for advanced degrees. Additionally,
we support trainees in the surgeon scientist program with extended funding,
contributing to their successful Master’s thesis defenses.

Our program’s greatest strength lies in its culture of collegiality, respect,
professionalism, and integrity. These values, established by past leaders, are
deeply ingrained in our faculty and trainees. Our graduates are not only
highly skilled but also exemplify these core principles in their practices,
providing exceptional care in their communities.

Equity is a cornerstone of our program, evident in our clinical and
educational practices. Staff surgeons share clinical and financial
responsibilities equally, promoting fairness regardless of surgical volume or
administrative duties. This commitment to equity fosters a diverse and
inclusive environment, reflected in the diversity seen in our graduate cohorts
over the past 2 decades.

Our training program stands as one of the oldest in Canada, distinguished by
its commitment to education, equity, professionalism, and patient care.
