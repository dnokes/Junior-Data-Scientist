# Selection Criteria

should assign the same set of documents to each site. Selection is based on
file review and one set of MMI interviews. Each file is reviewed and given a
score. This file review score determines whether a candidate is offered an
interview. The file review score is then combined with the interview score and
FMPROC score to create a total score for each applicant. **The file review
score will contribute to 20%, interview score will contribute to 75%, and
FMProC  will contribute to 5% of the overall global score**. A recommended
rank list based on the total score is submitted to each site for
consideration. The sites retain discretion to adjust the recommended rank list
based on local site selection committee input.

[Family Medicine training in BC](https://postgrad.familypractice.ubc.ca/)
presents you with many unique opportunities. We are a fully accredited

In an effort to meet the evolving needs of our society, each site provides a
solid foundation in the knowledge and clinical skills of Family Medicine so
that our graduates are prepared to practice in a variety of settings. While
our program offers diversity of training, it is based on [common goals,
learning objectives, and assessment
standards](https://postgrad.familymed.ubc.ca/program-info/).

All residents are required to do a [mandatory 2-month rural
rotation](https://postgrad.familymed.ubc.ca/resident-resources/rural-
rotation/) in Family Medicine in their second year. Residents in the Coastal,
or rural programs in the Okanagan or the North complete longer rural
placements. Residents can also apply to participate in Enhanced Rural training
for a total of 4-6 months in rural communities.

There is extensive [academic and administrative
support](https://postgrad.familymed.ubc.ca/about/program-matrix/) for the
entire residency program. Our central program administrative team is based in
Vancouver on UBC campus. At the site level, leadership teams are made up of a
Site Director, Site Faculty, Lead Residents and administrators. Lead Program
Faculty provide provincial education support in the areas of curriculum,
assessment, faculty development, scholarship and behavioral medicine.

The Family Practice Postgraduate Education Committee has representation from
all sites to ensure a connected, distributed program that fully meets
accreditation standards. Residents are represented at all levels of
governance.

A wide range of amazing recreational and cultural opportunities are at your

Resident Activities.  This funding is used to provide educational support to
residents during their 2 years of training. This includes funding for
residents to attend program-wide courses and events. Additionally, residents
may identify conferences and educational materials that would supplement their
training experience. A discretionary, per resident funding will also be
allocated to the sites for a similar purpose at the site level.

# Program Curriculum

St. Paul’s (CMG) Site offers opportunities to gain experiences in Inner City
Medicine, Addiction Medicine, LGBTQ2S Health, HIV/AIDS, Palliative Care,

in addictions, inner city medicine, HIV primary care, LGBTQIA2S+ medicine,
trauma informed care and participatory research.

# Training Sites

**Resources**

**St. Paul's Hospital Site**

Family Practice training is carried out in diverse community practices.
Residents are matched for two years with a community family practice preceptor
and spend time in downtown or surrounding community clinics that are oriented
to people living in the inner city and urban core. Residents also have the
opportunity to learn how to work effectively with people experiencing health
inequities due to discrimination and marginalization.

The majority of hospital training takes place at St. Paul's Hospital located
in downtown Vancouver. This is a tertiary referral hospital of 450 beds with a
busy emergency department and expertise in HIV/AIDs care and Addiction
Medicine. Training in Pediatrics takes place at B.C. Children's Hospital and
in outpatient clinics. Primary Care Maternity and Obstetrics/Gynecology are
offered at BC Women’s and St. Paul’s Hospitals.

Other elective experiences may occur at different sites in British Columbia.
St. Paul's has been a teaching hospital for over 75 years and has a proud
reputation for the quality of its teaching programs. Primary care research,
Behavioural Medicine and Resident wellness are well supported at St. Paul’s.
