# Important Information

Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada: Applying competency-based
practices to residency education

To contribute to the success of Canadian physicians and the delivery of high-
quality patient care, the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada
has embarked upon an initiative to introduce competency-based medical
education (CBME) in Canadian postgraduate specialty training and in
professional practice in Canada. This initiative, called [Competence by Design
(CBD)](http://www.royalcollege.ca/rcsite/competence-design-e), aims to enhance
patient care by aligning medical education and lifelong learning with evolving
patient needs and empowering learners to more fully engage in their education
process.

CBD will use [time as a
framework](http://www.royalcollege.ca/rcsite/cbd/competence-by-design-cbd-e)
rather than the basis for progression. It is not anticipated that the duration
of training will change for the majority of trainees. Residency programs will
be broken down into
[stages](http://www.royalcollege.ca/rcsite/documents/cbd/cbd-competence-
continuum-diagram-legal-e.pdf), and each stage will have a series of
milestones based on required competencies. These milestones will create more
targeted learning outcomes and involve more frequent, formative assessments
within the clinical workplace to ensure residents are developing and receiving
feedback on the skills they need.

Note that UBC Urology has initiated curriculum implementation of CBD in 2018
and all new recruits to the program will enter CBD training.

All programs implementing CBD will continue to undergo the same rigorous
accreditation processes as traditional programs. All CBD programs (and
traditional programs) will continue to lead to Royal College approved
certification. Certification for trainees in both CBD and traditional programs
will include the completion of a Royal College examination; however, residents
in CBD programs will also be assessed against program milestones throughout
their training. Within a CBD program, all milestones (documented within an
electronic portfolio) and the Royal College examination must be successfully
completed to achieve certification.

For more information, please contact
[cbd@royalcollege.ca](mailto:cbd@royalcollege.ca).

Le Collège royal des médecins et chirurgiens du Canada : Intégrer l’approche
par compétences à la formation des résidents

Le Collège royal des médecins et chirurgiens du Canada a lancé une initiative
qui intègre l’approche par compétences à la formation médicale postdoctorale
spécialisée et à la pratique professionnelle pour favoriser la réussite des
médecins canadiens et améliorer la prestation de soins de qualité aux
patients. Cette initiative, [La compétence par conception
(CPC)](http://www.collegeroyal.ca/rcsite/competence-design-f), vise à adapter
la formation médicale et l’apprentissage à vie des médecins aux besoins
changeants des patients et permettre aux apprenants de s’« approprier » leur
processus d'apprentissage pour améliorer les soins aux patients.

La CPC mesurera l’acquisition progressive des compétences [dans un cadre
temporel](http://www.collegeroyal.ca/rcsite/cbd/competence-by-design-cbd-f),
mais n’utilisera pas la durée de la formation comme base d’acquisition. Nous
ne nous attendons pas à ce que la durée de la formation change pour la plupart
des stagiaires. Les programmes de résidence seront divisés en plusieurs
[étapes](http://www.collegeroyal.ca/rcsite/documents/cbd/cbd-competence-
continuum-diagram-legal-f.pdf), et chaque étape sera assortie d’une série de
jalons liés aux compétences requises. Ceux-ci permettront de cibler les
résultats d'apprentissage et de procéder à des évaluations formatives plus
fréquentes en milieu clinique pour que les résidents développent les
compétences requises et reçoivent une rétroaction pertinente.

Les programmes qui adopteront la CPC seront encore soumis aux mêmes processus
d’agrément rigoureux que les programmes traditionnels. Les programmes sous la
CPC (et les programmes traditionnels) mèneront à l’obtention d’un certificat
du Collège royal. Les stagiaires inscrits aux programmes sous la CPC et aux
programmes traditionnels obtiendront leur certificat s’ils réussissent
l’examen du Collège royal; cependant, les résidents des programmes sous la CPC
seront aussi évalués en fonction des jalons établis par leur programme tout au
long de leur formation. C’est donc dire que les stagiaires inscrits à un
programme sous la CPC doivent avoir réussi tous les jalons (consignés dans un
portfolio électronique) ainsi que l’examen du Collège royal pour obtenir leur
certificat.

demonstrated interest and aptitude for urology and surgical procedures.

## Program goals

The mission of the UBC Department of Urologic Sciences Postgraduate Training
Program is to nurture leaders in Urology and launch careers. The UBC
Department of Urologic Sciences encompasses 5 main academic training hospitals
and over 30 key opinion leaders in Urology as mentors throughout the training
duration. We endeavor to develop graduates who go on to become leaders in
their communities, their hospitals, departments, associations, and globally.
This may take the form of Urology advocacy and teaching, or Hospital and
Health administration, or Health economics and business, or academic research
innovation. We mentor our trainees to become excellent Urologic Surgeons and
also support their graduation into exceptional subspecialty Fellowships and
Faculty positions thereafter.

## Selection process goals

The successful applicant to the UBC Urologic Sciences training program will
demonstrate qualities of commitment, resilience, 'grit', amicability and
teachability. We recognize that surgical training programs place stresses on
candidates lives in multiple domains including: relationships, family,
emotional/psychological/physical health and personal development. The
successful candidate must be willing and able to negotiate the oftentimes
difficult lines between external stressors of training and personal growth and
satisfaction, which can be at odds on occasion. The successful candidate will
likewise also recognize that Urologic training is an intermediate to a
lifetime of career opportunity and personal fulfillment. Amongst all traits to
be possessed by the applicant, the most treasured is that of teachabilty; the
ability to listen actively, to learn from seeing, to ask questions and remain
inquisitive, and to rapidly integrate those learnings into practice in facile
manner.  In our program, we generate excellent Urologic surgeons through
enormous clinical caseload and close mentorship in the OR and clinics, but our
emphasis is in launching careers built on CanMEDS intrinsic roles as well as
value add training including advocacy, entrepreneurship, governance, committee
