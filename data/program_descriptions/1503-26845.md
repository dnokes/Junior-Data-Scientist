# Important Information

The Public Health and Preventive Medicine Residency Training Program at the
University of Alberta for Canadian Medical Graduates (CMGs), Public Health and
Preventive Medicine including Family Medicine (PHPM_FM), includes a two-year
placement with Family Medicine, typically the first two years of the training
program. You do not need to apply to Family Medicine separately; this will be
considered in your application and interview.

### **CASPER Information**

All applicants to the PHPM residency program at the University of Alberta are
required to complete the CASPER (Computer-Based Assessment for Sampling
Personal Characteristics) test, to assist with our selection process.
Successful completion of CASPER is mandatory in order to maintain admission
eligibility. CASPER is an open-response, situational judgment test that
evaluates aspects of applicants’ social intelligence and professionalism such
as ethics, empathy, problem-solving and collaboration. For more information on
the test, go to[
https://takealtus.com/casper/.](https://takealtus.com/casper/) Casper scores
are only valid for a single admissions cycle and for the test type for which
you have taken the test. For example, if an applicant took the Canadian Post
Graduate Medical Education test for the CaRMS Round 1 match, the same Casper
score will be considered for the Round 2 match.

Your CASPER assessment result is sent directly to our program/CaRMS from
Acuity Insights. Please ensure that you give Acuity Insights permission to

# Program Highlights

The University of Alberta Residency Program aims to focus on giving residents
the practical experience they need to develop skills to work in all areas of
public health and preventive medicine.

### Strengths**  
**

  * A focus on the front-line practice of Public Health and Preventive Medicine
  * Close/frequent contact with preceptors
  * Wide range of available training options; flexibility to meet individual interests of residents
  * Continual exposure to Public Health and Preventative Medicine through Academic Half Day, even during Family Medicine training

### Other Key Features

The program has training options with the Occupational Medicine residency
program and the School of Public Health.

### **Common Clinical Encounters**

  * Management of respiratory and gastrointestinal disease outbreaks
  * Occupational and Environmental hazards to health
  * Communicable disease control and consultation on immunization issues
  * Work with vulnerable populations
  * Opportunities for experience in health promotion and chronic disease and injury prevention through some rotations and electives

### **Workload**

First third of program: Residents pursue certification in Family Medicine and
focus on specific areas of interest within the first two years of the program;
call is rotation-dependent.

Second third of program: The third year is an academic year, spent in Masters
coursework (including Epidemiology and Biostatistics) at the School of Public
Health at the University of Alberta or another academic institution (subject
to approval by the RPC) and can lead to an MPH or other Masters degree.

Final third of program: Senior rotations fulfill the Public Health and
Preventive Medicine training objectives. Opportunity to take first call with
preceptors during rotations enhances the training experience.

### **Research Expectations**

The academic year in the MPH program at the University of Alberta has a
practicum research project. Depending on resident interest, many other
research opportunities or quality improvement projects are available
throughout the program.

# Program Curriculum

This residency program is for 5 years.

Program length of training does not exceed the Royal College or College of
Family Physicians of Canada standard.

### PGY 1 and PGY 2

For details of the curriculum in year 1 and 2 in Family Medicine, please go
to:

<https://www.ualberta.ca/family-medicine/postgraduate/residency-
program/index2.html>

### PGY 3 - PGY 4

Academic courses for 12-20 months, including any project requirements, on a
full-time basis. This includes mandatory graduate courses in Epidemiology and
Biostatistics and can work towards a Masters degree at either the University
of Alberta or an alternate academic institution, subject to approval by the
Residency Program Committee (RPC). At the University of Alberta, this would
work toward a Master of Public Health (MPH) degree.

For more information: <https://www.ualberta.ca/public-health/programs/mph-
programs/index.html>  

### PGY 4

Complete academic courses per above.

Field placements providing specialized, practical skills in communicable
disease control, environmental health, health promotion, chronic
disease/injury prevention, surveillance and other basic public health topics.

### PGY 5

Field placements providing specialized, practical skills in health policy and
management of public health programs.

The last two years of the residency focus on rotations which provide the
specialized, practical skills and knowledge required by a public health and
preventive medicine specialist.  These rotations will be structured so as to
provide the resident with increasing responsibilities as they progress through
their training.  Communicable disease control, environmental health, chronic
disease/injury prevention, and surveillance rotations will provide a
foundation to the resident to then move into more complex areas such as health
policy, management of public health programs and vulnerable populations.

CaRMS Self-Identification Questionnaire (CSIQ)

The University of Alberta recognizes the importance of diversity, equity,
inclusivity, decolonization, and indigenization (EDIDI) and is committed to
the Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry’s policy on anti-racism.

Further, the University is committed to implementing the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission calls to action that are relevant to education and
medicine.The pursuit of diversity and equitable opportunities is a core value
that guides our selection practices.

The University encourages applications from underrepresented groups, including
Indigenous persons, persons with a disability, racialized persons, women,
persons of a minority gender identity or sexual orientation, and individuals
who would contribute to the diversity of the medical community. The CaRMS
Self-Identification Questionnaire (CSIQ) is an optional form that candidates
can fill out.

Our program recognizes the importance of EDIDI and anti-racism in residency
selection, but is currently not using the CSIQ as part of our application
process. We are using other methods to ensure mitigation of bias and equitable
opportunities for all applicants.

# FAQ

###  Specialty/Field Questions for Public Health/Preventive Medicine

  1. **What are some strengths about your specialty? What draws and keeps people in your specialty?  
** The focus on population health, prevention or early intervention in disease
processes.  
  
There are extensive opportunities to collaborate with other professionals and
provide physician leadership in program and/or policy development and
evaluation and research – every day is different!  
  
Opportunities for broad health impacts through programs and policies (eg.
vaccination program that have prevented and eliminated diseases).
Opportunities for further training in field epidemiology and occupational
medicine.

  2. **What are some common complaints about your specialty?  
** Direct patient care work can be limited, depending on the type of work
chosen within the specialty.

  3. **Why did you choose your specialty?  
** Opportunity to be proactive and deal with preventing problems/disease.  
  
Opportunity for large-scale health impacts across the population.

  4. **What types of clinical cases do you commonly see?  
** Although there are opportunities for direct patient work (e.g. in community
clinics or specialized clinics i.e. STI, TB, Inner City medicine, Travel), the
specialty is focused on dealing with the needs and problems in populations or
groups of people. So instead of a stethoscope and lab tests we are using
population diagnostic tools such as epidemiology, to study trends and risk
factors in diseases and instead of individual treatments, we provide programs
and policies to improve population health outcomes.  
  
Because a set of infectious diseases are reportable to Public health, we deal
routinely with these diseases that are reportable (eg. TB, STIs, travel
medicine, foodborne/waterborne illnesses), and environmental exposures;
however, injuries and non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, cardiac
disease, cancers and smoking-, nutrition- and sedentary-related illnesses are
also dealt with through a population-based approach (surveillance, disease
prevention, health promotion)

  5. **Briefly describe a typical day.**

    * Consulting with physicians, nurses and other professionals on public health issues
    * Responding to infectious disease outbreaks by working with a team of professionals investigating and working to control the outbreak 
    * Chairing meetings, such as on emergency planning and management
    * Meeting with staff to plan for chronic disease prevention program
    * Clinical work
    * Research / literature search / policy review
    * Help lead the response to emerging public health threats
    * Health Advocacy

    * Very flexible and accommodates varying needs.
    * Primarily office hours in addition to on call taken from home.

          **b) Specifically, how able is your specialty to accommodate family life?**

    * Most of the work is done during office hours on weekdays.
    * After hours call is taken from home, and most emergency issues can be dealt with from home by phone.
    * Opportunities for part-time work, including patient-care duties.

  7. **Range of incomes?**

    * Most positions are salaried and include health benefit plans, vacation, pensions, etc.
    * Salary range: $200,000 to $400,000, depending on years of practice and position, plus benefits which are considered to be about 20% of salary
    * Patient-care work would be added onto this base salary

  8. **How do you see your discipline changing over the next decade?**

    * Continued demand for Medical Officers of Health
    * Over the next ten years, there will be more demand for public health and preventive medicine specialists to work in areas outside of traditional public health roles, for example in Primary Care Networks / Family Care Clinics, community clinics, or as medical administrators
    * Emergency areas (infection control, emergency preparedness) will offer new career choices
    * Increasing work in Chronic Disease Prevention and Healthy Built Environments to address high and growing burdens of non-communicable diseases
    * Academic positions may also be available
