directed learner with a genuine interest in forming relationships with
patients then you should seriously consider our program.  

**Welcome from the Program Director**

Welcome to the University of Saskatchewan Family Medicine Program! My name is
Sheila Smith and I will be your program director. We want to support you to do
your best work. Our program provides opportunities to practice inclusive and
equitable care to our patients and our communities. You will experience
learning environments that are strengthened by our diverse and inclusive
teams. Our program is constantly learning and innovating and we welcome you to
be part of our journey.

**Important Information for Applicants**

schools. Applicants are responsible for reviewing the [University of
Saskatchewan Policies for the R1 Match](https://www.carms.ca/match/r-1-main-
residency-match/eligibility-criteria/saskatchewan/) to determine if they meet
all requirements and eligibility criteria. Failure to meet or provide proof of
any of the stated requirements or documents may result in an applicant’s file
not being reviewed or ranked.

All applicants must complete the Casper test. Please refer to the Examinations
section for more information.

educational register license throughout their entire training program. Matched
applicants who are graduating in the spring will need to provide a copy of
their medical degree/diploma to the PGME office and the College of Physicians

deadline to demonstrate they meet CPSS requirements. More information is
available under Supporting Documentation-Language Proficiency.

**NOTE:**  Applicants who are considering a delay to their convocation date

have convocated. CPSS bylaws require that new residents must have received
their medical degree prior to the commencement of residency training. Choosing

Authority may result in a delay in the start of postgraduate training beyond

Attendance is required and absences are only permitted in exceptional
circumstances, with prior approval of PGME.
