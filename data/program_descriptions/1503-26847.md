# Important Information

Your application to the Queen's Family Medicine Residency Program will be
centrally processed for all four training sites: Kingston-1000 Islands,
Belleville-Quinte, Peterborough-Kawartha, and Queen's-Bowmanville-Oshawa-
Lakeridge. This process means that you will only have one interview, with
results communicated to each site you have applied to. You must make a
separate application to each site you are interested in. Please _include all
required_  documentation in each application and submit the same documentation
to each site. You will have the opportunity to individually rank each site you
are interested in.

Family Medicine at Queen's is a fully accredited program with strong oversight
and communication across all four sites. Each site has a Site Director,
Curriculum Lead, Assessment Lead, Research and Informatics Lead, Faculty
Development Lead and a Program Coordinator to ensure there is strong
collaboration and communication across the sites.

**Note to Couples:**

You are welcome to indicate if you are applying to us as a "couple match". We
will make every attempt to schedule you and your partner for clinical
rotations/experiences that will allow you to have time together.

**EDIIA Institutional Statement:**

The goal of resident selection is to identify trainees likely to succeed both
in training and, once out in practice, in meeting the health care needs of
patients and Canadian society.  We know that having a physician workforce that
reflects the demographics of the patients that they serve improves health care
outcomes.  There are many populations within Canada under-represented in
medicine (UIM) with a paucity of health care practitioners who are Black,
Indigenous, Persons of Colour, 2SLGBTQ+, from lower socioeconomic backgrounds
and/or with disabilities, and other under-represented in medicine (UIM)
groups. Diversity within training programs has also been shown to improve
training environments.  Queen’s University PGME is strongly committed to
diversity and inclusion within its community for these reasons as well as
being part of the solution to address historic and contemporary inequities.

**Equity and diversity**

We welcome diversity among our trainees and seek to foster an environment that
is welcoming to all, regardless of gender identity, race, religion, or sexual
orientation.

We are committed to advancing equitable and inclusive practices.  Please refer
to the [PGME website](https://meds.queensu.ca/academics/postgraduate/faculty-
staff/applicant-selection) for additional information / resources including
[QHS EDIIA Initiatives](https://healthsci.queensu.ca/academics/edi) and [EDIIA
statements](https://healthsci.queensu.ca/academics/edi/accessibility-
statements) (Indigenous Land Acknowledgement, Anti-Discrimination Statement,
Inclusion Statement, and Statement on Social Accountability)

**Note to First Nation, Inuit and/or Métis  applicants:**

At the present time, CaRMS does not have a self-identification process for
First Nation, Inuit and/or Métis applicants. The Queen's Department of Family
Medicine is committed to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Calls to
Action on Health. For this reason, we offer any First Nation, Inuit and/or
Métis applicants to our residency program the opportunity to self-identify in
their personal letter during the application process. We also invite First
Nation, Inuit and/or Métis applicants offered interviews to self-identify when
selecting interview dates. This information helps us identify ways in which
the residency program can connect First Nation, Inuit and/or Métis applicants
to specific resources and supports.

**FMProC Details:**

All applicants (CMG and IMGs) to ALL Canadian Family Medicine Programs, in the
1st and 2nd rounds of the CaRMS cycle, are required to sit an online

# Program Highlights

Queen’s University Family Medicine is a highly regarded longstanding program
(established in 1972). Our two-year program is based on the College of Family
Physicians of Canada competency-based “Triple C” Curriculum (Comprehensive
learning; Continuity of patient care, curriculum, and supervision; and family
medicine-centred education). The program consists of core family medicine
experiences complemented by experiences in other specialties relevant to
family medicine.

In 2010, our program expanded from a single site in Kingston to three
different sites across southeastern Ontario (Kingston-1000 Islands,
Belleville-Quinte, and Peterborough-Kawartha). In 2012, a fourth site
(Queen's-Bowmanville-Oshawa-Lakeridge) was added. Our motto is, “Train at
Queen’s. Work Anywhere.” This is demonstrated by our graduates practising all
over Canada, from remote and rural areas to large inner-city practices. Using
centrally set objectives and assessment standards, all of our four vibrant
sites use their unique local strengths and resources to deliver exceptional
programs. Residents match to and train at one of our four sites, with all the
sites coming together three or four times a year for innovative teaching
sessions and social events. Queen’s Family Medicine has twice earned the
Professional Association of Residents of Ontario (PARO) [Residency Program
Excellence Award](https://myparo.ca/paro-awards/#residency-program-excellence-
award), making us the only program to win this prestigious recognition more
than once. Further, we are the only family medicine program in the province to
receive this award in its 15-year history. In addition to our two wins, we
have been nominated for this award in five other years, from 2012 to 2023
inclusive. We were also honoured to receive the 2014 [Keith
Award](https://www.srpc.ca/past-winners), given to the program with the
greatest number of residents practising in rural communities. Make sure to
explore our four program sites on our
[website](https://familymedicine.queensu.ca/academics)!

Our postgraduate program typically includes boot camp (an introductory block
to residency that residents endorse as setting a great foundation for their
training); a robust global health curriculum; an annual wilderness retreat;
innovative simulation courses (including our highly regarded Nightmares FM
course); international electives; opportunities to teach and engage in
research; and experiences in rural and remote community hospitals (including
Moose Factory, Ontario, and the Falkland Islands). Additionally, we have many
enhanced skills programs.

Peterborough-Kawartha Site Program Highlights

· A "horizontal" curriculum with continuous, community-based family medicine
experience for three half-days per week throughout most of the PGY1 and PGY2
years.

· Specialty experiences are completed horizontally three days per week in
blocks of four or eight weeks.

· The opportunity to work within well-developed, interdisciplinary family
health teams.

· Inpatient and emergency rotations in the state-of-the-art Peterborough
Regional Health Centre, which opened in 2008.

· Utilization of strong family physician-led services including palliative
care unit and Partners in Pregnancy Clinic.

· Repetition of experiences in PGY1 and PGY2 years to allow residents to
consolidate knowledge and increase confidence.

· Low ratio of residents to physician preceptors and abundant opportunity for
hands-on clinical experience. (FP residents will most often be the only
learner on a rotation).

· An appropriate balance between learning and service.

· Long-term care horizontal component in PGY1 (four LTC patients followed
through PGY1 under the supervision of LTC preceptor).

# Training Sites

**Peterborough and the Kawartha Lakes**

Peterborough is an active, thriving city that serves as the gateway to cottage
and lake country in the Kawarthas. It is a vibrant city of 84,000 that offers
an incredible quality of life. Although just over an hour northeast of
Toronto, Peterborough is a community unto itself, instead of a mere extension
of the Greater Toronto Region. Situated on the historic Trent-Severn Waterway,
and surrounded by 135 lakes, outdoor options as well as urban amenities are at
your doorstep.

The heart of the city is home to more than 60 restaurants that include
multicultural cuisine and fair-trade coffee shops, and the distinctive café
district. Our arts and culture community, backed by a strong grassroots scene,
is renowned for events, exhibitions, and performances. Peterborough is a
frequent stop for touring musicians, and the summer boasts twice-weekly open-
air concerts by the lake (for free!). There is a well-attended farmers' market
twice a week with fresh local produce.

Outdoor enthusiasts will find lots to do in every season. It is so easy to get
outside in Peterborough! In summer, cycle or hike the extensive local trail
systems or paddle the Otonabee River for the day. For the more adventurous,
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park offers a spectacular chain of lakes and
possibilities for week-long canoe trips. There are kilometers of well-
maintained walking/hiking trails in town and the surrounding areas. In winter,
cross-country ski through Jackson Creek Park in the heart of the city or
travel north to the Kawartha Nordic Ski Club for more than 50 km of trails.
For a magical experience, skate on the canal under the lights of the largest
hydraulic lift lock in the world.

Residents with families will find an excellent choice of schools, including
French Immersion and Montessori, as well as family activities. The
Peterborough Zoo, complete with train ride and splash pad in summer, is only
minutes away, and much of the city can be accessed via bike path, including
the zoo and two small beaches on Little Lake.

**What Makes the Peterborough-Kawartha Program Special?**

All family medicine residents in Peterborough-Kawartha work in family health
teams with their dedicated family medicine preceptor(s) during their two-year
residency. This longitudinal approach to family medicine helps build
relationships between the resident and their patients, and with their
preceptor. Weekly half day teaching sessions take place at the well known
“Queen’s House”, the home base of our residency program located down the
street from the hospital. Teaching sessions range from didactic in person
sessions to hands on workshops and problem based learning sessions.

The Peterborough Regional Health Centre (PRHC) is a busy 494-bed regional
health center that offers almost all medical services. In Peterborough, you
will see patients with a diverse mix of ages and presenting problems, and you
are guaranteed to see a high volume of patients in all services. Patients tend
to be complex with multisystem disease, and they benefit from the well-
supported specialist care that is available. As all in-hospital rotations are
done at PRHC, residents quickly become familiar with consultants from various
specialties and feel comfortable developing working relationships throughout
the hospital. Residents will work in the wards and outpatient clinics of PRHC.
They also rotate through other clinical environments including Hospice
Peterborough, the Partners in Pregnancy Clinic and outpatient medical/surgical
specialist offices. Family medicine residents are valued and appreciated in
Peterborough, and the feedback from patients, allied health professionals,
family physicians, and specialist physicians alike has been excellent. They
truly become members of our medical community.

**Primary Care in Peterborough**

In 2005, Peterborough was selected as one of the first communities in Ontario
to pilot the family health team (FHT) model of primary care provision. We
currently have five well-developed teams in the city and surrounding region
that have incorporated allied health professions including nurse
practitioners, dietitians, social workers, and pharmacists. FHT offices are
fully computerized, many of them elevating their practices with health
informatics. All primary family medicine preceptors in the program work in the
Peterborough Family Health Team (PFHT).

Our family medicine preceptors also provide exposure to the full scope of
family medicine including work in addictions, obstetrics, palliative care,
sports medicine, emergency medicine, hospitalist medicine and others.

Our family medicine physicians are respected and valued members of
Peterborough's’ medical community. The relationship built between our
residents and their longitudinal family medicine preceptors has been
identified as one of the biggest strengths of our program. Come learn with
family doctors who truly value primary care and see the best of family
medicine in action.

**Peterborough Regional Health Centre**

The Peterborough Regional Health Centre (PRHC), a state-of-the-art hospital
with a bed capacity of 494, opened in 2008. The hospital incorporates cutting-
edge technology including fully computerized diagnostic imaging, a cardiac
catheterization lab, MRI, and integrated bedside computer terminals. Serving a
regional population of more than 300,000, PRHC offers an extensive range of
services including one of the busiest emergency departments in the province.
The hospital has a busy 6 room labor and delivery unit and level two nursery.
The pediatric outpatient clinic and inpatient floor provides valuable
pediatric exposure to our residents. PRHC has a dedicated state of the art
palliative care unit. Although not in the hospital, our residents also work in
the Rapid Access Addiction Medicine (RAAM) clinic in downtown Peterborough
providing care to some of our most marginalized patients. Peterborough
Regional's longstanding relationship with the Queen's medical school
demonstrates our commitment to ongoing education and the training of
tomorrow's doctors. For more information, visit:

# Additional Information

Comprehensive learning means we will guide you as you become proficient in the
full scope of family medicine: office and community-based care, inpatient
care, emergency medicine, chronic care, obstetrics, and the psychosocial
aspects of medicine that affect all age groups. With the help of your academic
advisor, your learning needs are identified and adjusted three times a year
over the course of your training.

Continuity of patient care means we prioritize giving you opportunities to
follow patients in your family medicine clinics, hospitals, and long-term care
facilities. Continuity of supervision means you will have a designated primary
preceptor during each core family medicine placement and you will have one
academic advisor assigned for the duration of your residency. Continuity of
curriculum means each of your experiences will build upon the others as you
develop into a fully proficient and independent family physician. You will
also receive ACLS, ALARM, and NRP training.

During your first year, you will participate in our ‘Nightmares FM’ course,
which is unique to Queen’s and provides residents with a high level of code
and pre-code training. The course helps prepare you for your worst nightmares
while on call. You could be asked to resuscitate a simulated patient in a mock
ER, ward, or office setting. At the start of your first year you will
participate in two full days of Nightmares boot camp, followed by three half-
day follow-up sessions throughout the year to consolidate your skills.

Family medicine-centred education means you are always learning through the
lens of family medicine. You will work in many different clinical settings
with other family physicians and specialist colleagues who are enthusiastic
about family medicine learners.

Over your two years, you will complete a resident project. Options for the
project include: critical review, advocacy project, research project, ethics
project, and IT project — this culminating in either a poster or oral
presentation at our annual Primary Care Research Day. During your first year,
you will also complete a quality-improvement project within your family
medicine practice.

While each training site develops its own individual schedule, all our staff
work diligently to ensure your needs as a learner and as an individual are
met. As a resident, you will receive vacation time each year and educational
leave to attend conferences. Parental leave can easily be arranged, and if you
and your partner are both training at the same site, we will strive to ensure
your schedules are complementary. You will receive access to multiple point-
of-care tools as well as all other university resources. You will also be
entitled to a resident allowance that can be used to purchase learning
resources and subscriptions or to attend conferences. You will have a primary
clinical preceptor, an academic advisor, and a faculty advocate who are
available for discussion and assistance and to help guide you in your
competency development.

You will also have the opportunity to complete elective placements during your
residency. We encourage residents to complete electives that complement their
learning or enhance their understanding of an aspect of family medicine.
Residents may also target their electives towards global health, either by
going abroad or by working with a vulnerable population in Canada. You will
work with your academic advisor to determine your personal electives plan.

The Queen’s Department of Family Medicine offers a wide variety of enhanced
skills programs in the following areas: emergency medicine, anesthesia, global
health, women's health, care of the elderly, Indigenous health, enhanced/rural
skills, palliative care, and care of the developmentally disabled. These
programs are based out of our Kingston & 1000 Islands site, however, learners
complete placements in a variety of locations. These enhanced skills programs
are open equally to applications from residents from all sites.

Queen's offers a flexible program in family medicine delivered at four
different sites across South Eastern Ontario (Kingston & 1000 Islands,
Belleville-Quinte, Peterborough-Kawartha, and Queen's-Bowmanville-Oshawa-
Lakeridge). Each site covers the same program objectives but has unique
curricula. Make sure you explore our four program descriptions or [visit our
website](https://familymedicine.queensu.ca/academics). Our postgraduate
program includes a robust global health curriculum, an annual wilderness
retreat, international electives, opportunities to teach and engage in
research, and experiences in rural and remote community hospitals (including
Moose Factory, Ontario).

At Queen's, we respect you as an adult learner. We provide a program with many
diverse opportunities and resources to help you in your development as a
family physician.

Train at Queen's. Work Anywhere!
