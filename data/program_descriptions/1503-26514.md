# Selection Criteria

## Program goals

The Dalhousie Department of Family Medicine's program goal is to train
residents to be family physicians who through education, research,
comprehensive clinical care, and engagement in partnerships, meet the needs of
Maritime communities.  Residents are trained to address health needs of all
populations including underserved communities and individuals with complex
needs, giving them the ability to practice in diverse family practice
settings.  

Our program and university value the importance of equity, diversity and
inclusion (EDI) in residency education, and achieving a diverse and inclusive
group of residents is a goal in our selection process. The CaRMS Self
Identification Questionnaire advances diversity and inclusivity within the
residency program.

                                                 

## Selection process goals

As a program we are looking for applicants with solid people skills, a variety
of life experiences, an admirable work ethic and reasonable academic
background. We look for evidence of commitment to family medicine in your
personal letter. We are interested in candidates who are comfortable with
self-directed learning, with teamwork, with seeking out the countless learning
opportunities available, and with an interest in an appropriate balance
between personal life, family, community and professional life.

Dalhousie is committed to fostering a collegial culture grounded in diversity
and inclusiveness. The university encourages applications from Indigenous
persons, persons with a disability, racialized persons, women, persons of a
minority sexual orientation and/or gender identity, and all candidates who
would contribute to the diversity of our community.

Candidates are not required to submit the CaRMS Self Identification
questionnaire or to complete the verification process for Indigenous identity,
membership, or citizenship, but for those that do feel comfortable doing so
the information received would only be used to advantage those who would
contribute to the diversity of our community.

Any self identification questionnaires received and the results of the
verification process will be reviewed as part of our file review process, and
used as an aid for file reviewers in selecting a diverse group of candidates
for interviews. Information received may also be used by the program to adjust
final rankings, at the discretion of the selection committee, to address
issues of program priority and diversity.

reviewers from each site.

# Program Highlights

**The Dalhousie Program - An Overview:**

Have you always wanted to learn in a community setting where family physicians
are respected and valued? If so, Dalhousie is the place for you. Teaching
residents and students in communities across the Maritimes has been the focus
of our Department from its beginnings. Our aim is to encourage residents to
become effective, compassionate family physicians who can care for their
patients in hospital, ambulatory and community settings. You will be able to
learn office practice, in-patient care, obstetrics, procedures and emergency
skills from family physicians who are skilled and experienced.

**_What support is available to residents in the program including rural
clinical learning experiences?_**

Residents are only expected to pay rent in one location. Thus, if a resident
has a lease or a mortgage, and the program requires them to live at another
site for a period of time, the cost of the rent is reimbursed to the resident.
Travel expenses are paid when a resident is required to move to a different
site for a core clinical learning experience. If residents are required to
travel to multiple sites during a core clinical learning experience, they are
reimbursed for the additional kilometres. Travel to and from work is not
reimbursed.

**_Are there opportunities for electives?_**

Residents in the Dalhousie University program can arrange up to four weeks of
their elective time outside of the Maritime Provinces. Other elective time
should be done in the Maritime Provinces.  Residents can apply to do more than
four weeks outside the Maritime Provinces for global health experiences.

**_What are the research requirements of the program?_**

A resident project is required during the residency. Residents receive
protected time for scholarly activity during the core family medicine clinical
learning experience to work on this project. It is also expected that the
residents will take advantage of any expertise available to them through their
community practice clinical learning experiences. The purpose of the resident
project is to introduce the resident to the process of finding answers to
questions commonly encountered in primary care by critically reviewing the
available literature. Where such answers are found lacking, the resident may
choose to employ an appropriate methodology to design a study using proper
scientific rigour, to answer that question.

**_What about ATLS, ALARM, ACLS and NRP?_**

Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS), Advances in Labour and Risk Management
(ALARM), Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS), Neonatal Resuscitation Program
(NRP) - **All residents are required to have ACLS prior to beginning
residency**. During the residency, all residents are funded to attend an ATLS
course, an ALARM course, an NRP course, and an ACLS refresher.

**_How do residents learn evidence-based medicine and research skills?_**

Current approaches to practicing evidence-based medicine are taught through
patient and practice-based tutorials. Emphasis is on learning the skills to
seek the research evidence to support clinical decision-making.

**_What PGY3 positions are available?_**

There are PGY3 positions in Emergency Medicine, Palliative Care and Care of
the Elderly at Dalhousie. Individualized third year programs may also be
available at a resident's request and initiative and subject to funding
availability.

\----

**The SYDNEY PROGRAM - Introduction:**

The Sydney program is a community based family medicine residency teaching
program in association with Dalhousie University.  We are located in Sydney,
on beautiful Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia.  We are comprised of four acute
care facilities and five rural facilities with our major referral center, Cape
Breton Regional Hospital, being located in the city of Sydney.  The Cape
Breton Regional Hospital serves both as the community hospital for Sydney and
surrounding area, as well as the regional referral center for the Island.  We
are the second busiest healthcare facility in Nova Scotia with over 9,400
acute admissions/year and over 41,000 emergency department visits/year.
Again, only second to the QEII in Halifax, we have the highest patient care
mix (degree of patient complexity) in the province.  We have a dedicated staff
of more than 3,500 health care providers who work with 270 hospital and
community based physicians to provide primary, secondary and tertiary care to
approximately 130,000 people.

The Cape Breton Family Medicine Residency Program was established in 1997.
The program is designed to prepare residents to become family physicians who
are confident and competent to practice in rural and urban setting where
specialty services are reasonably accessible.

Our community-based program uses a preceptor model for our family medicine
clinical learning experiences and most specialty clinical learning
experiences. In this model the resident is assigned to one preceptor and
participates in all aspects of patient care that the preceptor is involved in.
In this manner we try to maximize the hands on practical learning experience
for each resident. Throughout the program we try to emphasize the role of
family physicians in all aspects of patient care and in all health care
settings (office, community, nursing home, emergency and hospital).

**THE SYDNEY PROGRAM - Unique Features:**

\- A multi specialty regional hospital with full integration of family
medicine within a collegial, multi-disciplinary atmosphere.

\- The Cape Breton Regional Hospital in Sydney is the primary teaching
facility for specialty rotations.

\- Residents have an opportunity to be matched to a preceptor with similar
interests (ie. EM, palliative care, obstetrics).

\- All core training is done in Cape Breton with limited time away from the
resident's primary site.

\- Residents spend one full day bi-weekly at their primary family medicine
preceptor's office through specialty rotations.

\- We foster a collaborative learning model and encourage teaching by our
residents to our junior learners.  Services do not often have multiple
learners together.

\- Local staff and facilities for teaching with strong links to Dalhousie
University and the other teaching sites involved in the Dalhousie University
Family Medicine Residency Program. This allows for shared expertise across all
sites for education and quality control.

\- Comprehensive curriculum, coordinated with the other training sites,
involving local family physicians, specialist and allied healthcare faculty.

\- Academic time is one half day every 2 weeks throughout PGY1 and PGY2.

**THE SYDNEY PROGRAM - Clinical Learning Experiences:_  
_**

**_Core Family Medicine:_**

Our teaching practices place residents with community-based family physicians.
Using this preceptor model the residents are placed in practices that expose
them to a wide spectrum of family medicine. In this way residents are exposed
to a large number of patients with a wide variety of illnesses in a number of
clinical settings (office, hospital, nursing home, house calls, etc). A
resident's level of responsibility will be graded as clinical skills improve
and individual performance becomes more efficient and effective.

**_Rural/Community Family Medicine:_**

In the first year residents will experience four weeks in one of our beautiful
rural/community locations: Baddeck, Cheticamp, Arichat or Neil's Harbour.  In
second year, residents spend 12 weeks in one of these communities.

**_Evidence Based Medicine:_**

Critical appraisal skills are taught through a series of evidence-based
medicine seminars that form part of our Journal Club. Here residents are
taught to formulate a clinical question, search the literature and then
evaluate the evidence to support clinical decision-making.

**

**What is the ratio of residents to faculty?**

Although we are an active teaching site, for the most part, our residents
enjoy the fact that there is minimal overlap with undergraduate students or
specialty residents during their various clinical learning experiences. This
combined with our preceptor model usually ensures that our residents have a
one-to-one ratio with their assigned faculty preceptor.

**

**What is the average patient load per resident?**

The family practices in Cape Breton are very busy. Residents see as many
patients per day as their comfort level and competence permits.
