# Return of Service

Ontario's International Medical Graduate (IMG) Return of Service (ROS) program
is intended to improve access to physician services across Ontario,
particularly in areas with limited physician supply.  The IMG ROS program
offers participants a postgraduate medical training position in return for a
commitment to practise medicine in an eligible Ontario community. The ROS
contract is between the Ministry of Health and the successful applicant, and
is the responsibility of the applicant to confirm eligibility with respect to
ROS requirements of other provinces. Ontario PGME offices are not involved in
this process.  

The Ministry requests all ROS agreements before July 1 of the year they were
matched. All agreements should be returned to the Ministry prior to the start
of residency training.

## **Download Form:  [TMU Regional Connection
Attestation](https://www.carms.ca/pdfs/TMU-regional-connection-
attestation-2025.pdf)**

We understand that a number of applicants to our residency programs will have
a connection to the Peel region and surrounding communities, and that many
applicants will also have an interest in serving culturally diverse and
medically underserved communities.  
  
Building upon our strong foundation of social accountability, we have
implemented a **Regional Connection Attestation** to help identify candidates
who may have a connection to the region.  
  
All applicants are asked to complete this attestation. The information

Self-identification questionnaire

Equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) are fundamental values at TMU and the
School of Medicine. As the first medical school in Canada founded and
intentionally built upon the foundations of social accountability, EDI,
decolonization and Reconciliation. These principles have been intentionally
infused throughout all facets of the TMU School of Medicine, including
admissions.  
  
We recognize that many groups face barriers not only in applying and being
admitted to medical school, but also in matching into residency programs. With
this in mind, and in keeping with TMU’s mission, vision and values,**  our
PGME Office and residency programs are asking applicants to optionally
complete the CaRMS Self-Identification Questionnaire and to assign the
document with their application to our program.**  
  
**This information will be used to support our goal of selecting a diverse
group of candidates to interview and subsequently rank**. Your information
will also be used to produce aggregate data. Following the CaRMS Match,
anonymized aggregate data from the CSIQ will be used to evaluate the
effectiveness of our selection process in removing barriers and promoting
inclusion, and to help us set EDI goals for future matches.

All members of the TMU PGME Office, program faculty and staff, file reviewers,
interviewers, and program selection committees undergo mandatory unconscious
bias and anti-racism training specifically geared to admissions and selection
and must also sign a Confidentiality and Conflict of Interest Agreement.
Additionally, to help ensure an equitable and accessible admissions and
selection process, we are committed to providing reasonable accommodations for
candidates who may require them in the interview process.

  
**Information on how this information will be accessed and protected by TMU**
:  
  
Your information will remain confidential, but not anonymous. Only a few
authorized individuals in PGME, including the Program Director and Program
Administrator, will have access to individual responses from individual
candidates. All personal information that is collected will be used, stored,
and destroyed in accordance with [TMU's Notice of
Collection](https://www.torontomu.ca/registrar/privacy/).  
  
Your self-identification information will be stored and maintained by the
individuals mentioned from the Postgraduate Medical Education Office and
destroyed in alignment with [TMU's records retention
schedule](https://www.torontomu.ca/gcbs/what-we-do/records/records-retention/)
and the [Ontario Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act
(FIPPA)](https://www.torontomu.ca/gcbs/what-we-do/access-privacy/). No

**LEARN Time**

A novel program called LEARN Time (Leadership, Education, Advocacy, Research,
and Non-clinical Time) will allow residents who are meeting or exceeding the
standards of their program to access protected time that they may direct
toward opportunities for experiential learning activities.  
  

  * It is anticipated that many residents will leverage this time to participate in work worthy of publication and scholarly work. While this program will be overseen by the Program’s Competence Subcommittees, central support for some elements of the LEARN Time program will also be provided. In particular, annual LEARN Time events will connect residents with individuals working in other areas of TMU, Peel, and surrounding committees. This will allow for some ‘scholarly matchmaking’ to happen outside of the Program to connect residents with a broader array of scholarly opportunities.  
  

  * Residents may also use LEARN time to engage in other leadership and advocacy work, such as with the Ontario Medical Association, Professional Association of Residents of Ontario, Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, College of Physician and Surgeons of Ontario etc.), allowing residents to engage with formal leadership and other opportunities early on in their careers. Residents may also choose to engage in formal teaching and mentorship of TMU School of Medicine undergraduate medical students. They will be provided a formal curriculum as well as informal mentorship opportunities for developing teaching skills.

# Training Sites

The TMU School of Medicine currently has clinical partnerships with four major
training sites:

  * [William Osler Health System](https://www.williamoslerhs.ca/en/index.aspx)
  * [Trillium Health Partners](https://www.thp.ca/Pages/Home.aspx)
  * [Headwaters Health Care Centre](https://www.headwatershealth.ca/)
  * [Halton Healthcare ](https://www.haltonhealthcare.on.ca/)

[**TMU Clinical Affiliate Map  
**  
](https://maphub.net/tmu_medicine/tmu-school-of-medicine-affiliations) As the
School of Medicine announces additional partnerships, the sites for core
program rotations may change. Residency training will leverage a distributed
model which may include training at any of these sites for learning in
environments, which include community and clinical settings, urban and rural
environments, and inpatient and outpatient settings. While the majority of
resident training will be focused in Peel and surrounding communities,
additional learning experiences may take place at other training sites within
Canada through Inter-University Affiliation Agreements. These agreements are
subject to change and result in training at sites other than those that are
listed above.

Travel to various locations will be required. Access to a personal vehicle
will be beneficial, though anyone with access to a reliable means of
transportation is encouraged to consider this program.
