# Selection Criteria

## Program goals

The Dalhousie Department of Family Medicine's program goal is to train
residents to be family physicians who through education, research,
comprehensive clinical care, and engagement in partnerships, meet the needs of
Maritime communities.  Residents are trained to address health needs of all
populations including underserved communities and individuals with complex
needs, giving them the ability to practice in diverse family practice
settings.  

Our program and university value the importance of equity, diversity and
inclusion (EDI) in residency education, and achieving a diverse and inclusive
group of residents is a goal in our selection process. The CaRMS Self
Identification Questionnaire advances diversity and inclusivity within the
residency program.

                                                 

## Selection process goals

As a program we are looking for applicants with solid people skills, a variety
of life experiences, an admirable work ethic and reasonable academic
background. We look for evidence of commitment to family medicine in your
personal letter. We are interested in candidates who are comfortable with
self-directed learning, with teamwork, with seeking out the countless learning
opportunities available, and with an interest in an appropriate balance
between personal life, family, community and professional life.

Dalhousie is committed to fostering a collegial culture grounded in diversity
and inclusiveness. The university encourages applications from Indigenous
persons, persons with a disability, racialized persons, women, persons of a
minority sexual orientation and/or gender identity, and all candidates who
would contribute to the diversity of our community.

Candidates are not required to submit the CaRMS Self Identification
questionnaire or to complete the verification process for Indigenous identity,
membership, or citizenship, but for those that do feel comfortable doing so
the information received would only be used to advantage those who would
contribute to the diversity of our community.

Any self identification questionnaires received and the results of the
verification process will be reviewed as part of our file review process, and
used as an aid for file reviewers in selecting a diverse group of candidates
for interviews. Information received may also be used by the program to adjust
final rankings, at the discretion of the selection committee, to address
issues of program priority and diversity.

# Program Highlights

**The Dalhousie Program - An Overview:**

Have you always wanted to learn in a community setting where family physicians
are respected and valued? If so, Dalhousie is the place for you. Teaching
residents and students in communities across the Maritimes has been the focus
of our Department from its beginnings. Our aim is to encourage residents to
become effective, compassionate family physicians who can care for their
patients in hospital, ambulatory and community settings. You will be able to
learn office practice, in-patient care, obstetrics, procedures and emergency
skills from family physicians who are skilled and experienced.

**_What support is available to residents in the program including rural
clinical learning experiences?_**

Residents are only expected to pay rent in one location. Thus, if a resident
has a lease or a mortgage, and the program requires them to live at another
site for a period of time, the cost of the rent is reimbursed to the resident.
Travel expenses are paid when a resident is required to move to a different
site for a core clinical learning experience. If residents are required to
travel to multiple sites during a core clinical learning experience, they are
reimbursed for the additional kilometres. Travel to and from work is not
reimbursed.

**_Are there opportunities for electives?_**

Residents in the Dalhousie University program can arrange up to four weeks of
their elective time outside of the Maritime Provinces. Other elective time
should be done in the Maritime Provinces.  Residents can apply to do more than
four weeks outside the Maritime Provinces for global health experiences.

**_What are the research requirements of the program?_**

A resident project is required during the residency. Residents receive
protected time for scholarly activity during the core family medicine clinical
learning experience to work on this project. It is also expected that the
residents will take advantage of any expertise available to them through their
community practice clinical learning experiences. The purpose of the resident
project is to introduce the resident to the process of finding answers to
questions commonly encountered in primary care by critically reviewing the
available literature. Where such answers are found lacking, the resident may
choose to employ an appropriate methodology to design a study using proper
scientific rigour, to answer that question.

**_What about ATLS, ALARM, ACLS and NRP?_**

Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS), Advances in Labour and Risk Management
(ALARM), Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS), Neonatal Resuscitation Program
(NRP) - **All residents are required to have ACLS prior to beginning
residency**. During the residency, all residents are funded to attend an ATLS
course, an ALARM course, an NRP course, and an ACLS refresher.

**_How do residents learn evidence-based medicine and research skills?_**

Current approaches to practising evidence-based medicine are taught through
patient and practice-based tutorials. Emphasis is on learning the skills to
seek the research evidence to support clinical decision-making.

**_What PGY3 positions are available?_**

There are PGY3 positions in Emergency Medicine, Palliative Care and Care of
the Elderly at Dalhousie. Individualized third year programs may also be
available at a resident's request and initiative and subject to funding
availability.

\----

**ANNAPOLIS VALLEY PROGRAM - Introduction**

Applicants ideally suited for this site are interested in life in rural Nova
Scotia where they and their families integrate into the communities in the
Annapolis Valley.  This integrated program incorporates the Triple C
competency-based curriculum that is "comprehensive, focused on continuity of
education and patient care and predominantly centered in family medicine".
Throughout their training residents will work toward fulfilling the CanMEDs-
Family Medicine framework which defines the competencies appropriate for
family physicians.  The ultimate goal is to produce competent highly skilled
physicians who provide comprehensive care for their patients.

**ANNAPOLIS VALLEY PROGRAM - Rotations**

This Annapolis Valley Program focuses learning primarily in a family medicine
setting with family physicians as teachers/mentors in a **longitudinal
experiential format** rather than the traditional block or rotational format.
As such, the majority of the learning and clinical experience in this program
is centered with the family medicine preceptors who practice comprehensive
family medicine in a variety of settings, including offices, hospitals,
nursing homes, ER, house calls and OR assists.  These practices range from
fee-for-service to innovative collaborative interdisciplinary care models.

**ANNAPOLIS VALLEY PROGRAM - Unique Features**

The Annapolis Valley site was the first in the Dalhousie Family Medicine
programs to offer an almost completely integrated competency-based program
centered in family medicine.  

During the two-year program, residents will take on a panel of patients for
whom they will provide care over various domains of practice including the
emergency department, inpatient ward and specialist appointments.

The curriculum allows for the development of longitudinal relationships
between the resident and patients ensuring continuity of care for patients and
continuity for learning.

Likewise, continuity of the learning environment is maintained since residents
will work primarily in the same family medicine environment and have
experiences in specialty areas over the course of the whole program.

Teaching and assessment is facilitated by a small core of family physician
preceptors thereby ensuring comprehensive assessment of the resident over
time.

Experienced and skilled family physicians form the core of the educational
faculty.

The curriculum is focused on the achievement of competency rather than on the
length of time of training.

The program allows residents to take responsibility for their learning, skill
development and demonstrating acquisition of competencies.

Residents may be involved in the teaching of medical students and clinical
clerks.

The training of residents will be done throughout the Annapolis Valley in
vibrant communities in either a collaborative interdisciplinary team or a fee-
for-service model.

**What is the ratio of residents to faculty?**

The Annapolis Valley program is based on a preceptor model.  Teaching and
assessment of a resident will be facilitated by one to two primary family
medicine preceptors who will ensure continuity of supervision throughout the
entire two-year residency. This arrangement will allow residents to have a
one-to-one relationship with their mentors.

Residents will also work with specialists/consultants who are very focused on
family medicine teaching with minimal competition with other learners.

**What resources are available?**

Each Family Medicine practice has computer workstations equipped with high-
speed internet connectivity, electronic medical records (EMR), e-mail and
videoconferencing.  In addition, each hospital location is equipped for
residents with a desk, computer, network and printer connection, microwave and
lockers.

The main Medical Education building which contains a resident lounge/study
area, call rooms and program administration is located on the grounds of
Valley Regional Hospital in Kentville.

Residents will also have online access to Dalhousie University Library
Services with its extensive online Journals.

**What is the average patient load per resident?**

Residents will be responsible for a cohort of patients (patient panel) over
the two-year program.  Initially residents are booked lightly to ensure that
they develop outstanding clinical and practice management skills.  Residents
will be encouraged to increase their responsibilities as their experience,
skills, confidence and competence develop.  By the end of the two years,
residents will be functioning at almost the same level as their preceptors and
will be ready for independent practice.

**PGY1 and PGY2 Experiences**  
---  
  |  The curriculum (academic and clinical) is set by the Curriculum Committee which includes members from all ten teaching sites (Annapolis Valley, Cape Breton, Fredericton, Halifax, Miramichi, Moncton, North Nova, Prince Edward Island, Saint John and South West Nova). In the Annapolis Valley site, resident training is focused on the College of Family Physicians of Canada (CFPC) Triple-C competency-based curriculum. The curriculum also incorporates the CanMEDS-Family Medicine framework, priority topics and key features, core procedures/skill dimensions as outlined by the CFPC. The clinical curriculum is delivered in a longitudinal integrated format over the two years of residency with the family medicine experience being the largest component. Longitudinal experiences will also be provided in Emergency Medicine, Internal Medicine, Orthopaedics, General Surgery, Pediatrics, Psychiatry and Palliative Medicine.  Limited traditional block rotations are completed for experience in Obstetrics and Gynecology. The academic curriculum is delivered approximately every three weeks for all residents at the Annapolis Valley site. Additionally Journal Club is held with participation from residents and family physicians. Throughout the two years all residents in the Dalhousie Family Medicine program also attend problem-based learning groups. The topics are common family medicine problems and the modules used are the practice based small group learning modules developed by McMaster University for family physicians. This has been a very effective way to ensure that residents have a good grounding in the basics of family medicine. Residents will also have time allocated for electives (eight weeks) and other learning experiences as required.
