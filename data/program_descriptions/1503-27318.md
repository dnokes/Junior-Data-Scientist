# Program Curriculum

This residency program is for 2 years.

Program length of training does not exceed the Royal College or College of
Family Physicians of Canada standard.

**Overview**

Our Program underwent a full Accreditation review by the CFPC in 2022 with
very positive results.

Like all FM Residency Programs in Canada, we have reviewed and redesigned our
curriculum, effective July 2012, so that it is very clearly Centered in FM,
based on Continuity of care and education, and focused on graduating
outstanding Family Physicians who can provide Comprehensive care ('Triple C').
The College of Family Physicians of Canada Triple-C curriculum model can be
found at <http://www.cfpc.ca/triple_C/>.

Our curriculum is based on competency acquisition. The Program provides you
with the learning opportunities and resources that result in the skills and
competencies you require as a practicing Family Physician. You “learn the
right thing, from the right people in the right place, at the right time”.

Your Home Clinic will be your educational home for the duration of the
Program. In this clinic you will learn with your FM Competency Coach and
associated clinic Preceptors 2 to 4.5 days per week throughout 6 blocks in
first year and 6 blocks in second year. By basing your learning in your Home
Clinic, you will develop and maintain continuing care for a group of patients
for which you are responsible – your patient panel. From the moment you begin
the Program, you start building your skills and identity as a Family Physician
and by the end of your training the patients for whom you have been
responsible, will and should recognize you as “their” Family Doctor.

We are a medium-to-large sized Residency Program with approximately 70
incoming Residents each year.  There are currently more than 160 Calgary
Program Residents.  In order to maintain a small Program feel where your
colleagues and Program staff know you, we are operationally organized into 3
Divisions.  These Divisions are geographically organized based on the
locations of our FM Home Clinics \- Northeast, Northwest, and South.  Each
Division has a Division Director and Division Coordinator to support your
learning.

**Curriculum  **

The Program is centered in FM and focuses on providing experiences of
Continuity of care and education and on graduating outstanding Family
Physicians able to provide Comprehensive care for patients, wherever they are
('Triple C').

This Program has been in existence since 2012 when we completed a major
curriculum review and redesign. The Program is a blend of longitudinal FM
experience, ambulatory clinical experiences (ACEs), hospital immersion
rotations, and electives.

Learning experiences have been reviewed and updated based on Resident and
Preceptor input.  We have undergone a review of our curriculum in 2020 to
ensure that the educational content we are providing to our residents remains
appropriate and high quality. We have made changes that benefit residents in
the following ways: scheduling more consecutive blocks of FM rotations,
modifying FM rotations to accommodate more days in Home Clinic, modifying our
outpatient and ambulatory care experiences, and reducing travel for our
residents.

We have a leading edge Resident Assessment Program that has, as one of its
founding principles, the concept that assessment is **for**  learning, not
just **of**  learning. We have moved away from summative assessments at the
end of rotations to an assessment system that monitors progress of a
Resident's learning over 2 years.

**If this sounds appealing to you, then please read on. The following two
sections outline the Resident experience on a weekly basis. Detailing the type
and frequency of learning you will do during the program.   **

**First Year**** **

  1. A FM Core Block in the first 4 weeks of Residency  
  2. Five additional FM based blocks
  3. Six blocks of immersion rotations including Obstetrics/Low Risk, Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, Psych EM, and Adult EM 
  4. One block of electives

**Second Year**** **

  1. Six FM-based blocks, including two blocks of Rural FM at a site in Southern Alberta
  2. Five immersion blocks –Hospitalist, Care of the Elderly, 2 weeks MSK & 2 weeks Low Risk Obstetrics Call, Palliative Care, and Pediatric Emergency
  3. Two blocks of Electives. You may select ICU and/or CCU/cardiology for one or two of these elective blocks

## **Program Conferences and Scholarship Day**

Two Resident conferences (Fall and Spring) and a Scholarship Day are held each
year in conjunction with the Rural Family Medicine residents. Costs for the
conferences are covered by the Program.  The conferences provide opportunities
for team-building as well as providing more time to focus on specific aspects
of FM with invited speakers and different educational formats.

Scholarship Day is held each Spring and is an opportunity for residents to
showcase their QI projects.

The Conferences and Scholarship Day are also an opportunity for Residents from
all streams of the program to meet up and share experiences.



## **Research/Evidence Based Medicine/Quality Improvement/Patient Safety  **

The Program provides the clinical and didactic learning experiences around
critical appraisal, evidence-based medicine and quality improvement for you to
graduate with the skills you will need as a future Family Physician. You
complete a Quality Improvement project in both first year and second year.

## **A****c****ademics**  

We provide weekly half-day academics throughout your Program. All academics
seminars supplement your clinical learning.  Topics are drawn from the 105
“Priority Topics/Learning Objectives” listed for the CCFP exam and the
CanMEDS-FM roles. To help with preparation for the CCFP exam, we provide
practice sessions for the Simulated Office Oral (“SOO”) and the Short Answer
Multiple Problem (“SAMP”) written component.

* * *

# Training Sites



## FM Home Clinics

There are 11 "Home Clinic" FM Teaching Sites associated with our Calgary
Program. Each offers a solid educational experience in FM and provides you
with an “educational home”.

All sites have enthusiastic and experienced preceptors with electronic medical
records. Almost all are located within the city of Calgary with three in
nearby communities (e.g. Airdrie and Black Diamond).

Sites represent varied “cradle to grave” patient populations - from inner
