# Program Highlights

### UBC Pediatric Residency Program

The UBC general pediatric residency training program strives to provide a
broad inpatient, ambulatory and community educational base to equip general
pediatricians with the skills necessary for independent practice and/or
successful transition to subspecialty training. Training within the tertiary
care setting helps graduates develop the confidence and skills necessary to
treat children with medical and psychosocial complexity, and excellent
exposure to all pediatric subspecialties. This is complemented by mandatory
time spent each year in community practices and hospitals around the province
where trainees benefit from increased independence and unique learning
opportunities.  Our pediatric residency training program is committed to
providing an excellent educational experience within the guidelines of the
Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada.

Residents attend mandated academic activities, including academic half-days
and Grand Rounds on a weekly basis. These are video-conferenced to our
distributed sites throughout the province. There are two mandatory resident
retreats and a Careers Night annually, attended by residents from both sites.

Residents also practice resuscitation scenarios in the high-fidelity simulator
program, both on acute care rotations (PICU and emergency medicine) and in
their longitudinal simulation curriculum in the academic half-day. Regular
mock codes take place for residents on the clinical teaching unit (CTU).

### Research

Research is a high priority of all the divisions within the Department of
Pediatrics.  Most departmental members are active investigators.  The BC
Children’s Hospital Research Institute (BCCHRI) located beside BC Children's
Hospital, is dedicated to world-class research spanning a wide range of
children's and women's health concerns. It is the largest research institute
of its kind in Western Canada.

All residents are expected to work on clinical, basic science, quality
improvement or medical education research and to present their work at least
once, either at the annual research day or at a conference. First year
residents take part in a 24-hour research curriculum during the academic half-
day. The resident Journal Club is scheduled bimonthly and introduces residents
to key clinical research methodologies and critical appraisal of the
literature.

### Global Child Health & Social Pediatrics

The UBC Department of Pediatrics and the pediatrics residency program have a
commitment to social justice as a lens for all pediatric care, and to
addressing health inequities affecting children and youth. In addition to a
mandatory social pediatrics rotation, residents have opportunities to engage
in resident-driven local health advocacy projects, outreach programs in BC, as
well as global child health initiatives, including local social pediatrics
electives and electives overseas.

Residents can participate in the outreach visits to Haida Gwaii and
Smithers/Hazelton, as well as the Brighter Smiles program that serves several
First Nations communities.

Currently, partnerships exist with hospitals in South Africa and Australia,
allowing senior trainees the opportunity to ethically participate in extended
(three-month) global health electives.

### UBC Vancouver Island and Fraser Sites of the UBC Pediatrics Residency
Training Program

A unique aspect of the UBC Pediatrics Residency Program is that it has three
base sites.   The  Vancouver Island site of the program is in Victoria.  The
Fraser site of the program is based in Surrey, with training experiences in
several other hospitals and practices in the Fraser region.  Residents from
these sites spend 6-16 weeks per year at BC Children’s Hospital, and
participate in program-wide academic half day (via videoconferencing),
retreats, and in training exams (written and OSCE).  They have their own CaRMS
PGY-1 matched spots.

### **Community Impact stream**

One resident each year from the Vancouver site may choose to match to the
Community Impact stream, which has a focus on providing pediatric care to
underserved communities and populations.  Six blocks of the Foundations
curriculum are based in Prince George, a regional centre in Northern BC. CTU,
community pediatrics and level II NICU are experienced in an integrated
longitudinal manner.  Priority is given for outreach and global health
experiences.  These residents have the opportunity to do their continuity
clinic in the downtown eastside of Vancouver. They are also encouraged to
focus their scholarly project around a relevant issue facing underserved
communities. This is a separate CaRMS PGY1 match.

**Research Track**

One resident a year from the Vancouver site may choose to match to the
Research track.  The research track provides substantial opportunity to
enhance research interests, refine skills in research methodology, interact
with other Faculty and trainees conducting research, and to present and
publish academic work. The nature of the research focused program will require
residents to be flexible, accommodating the needs of their research project
and collaborators, while meeting the clinical demands of the general pediatric
program. An estimated total of six months will be dedicated to research
throughout residency, without extending residency training.  This is a
separate CaRMS PGY1 match.

###  *The Vancouver Island site, Fraser site, Community Impact stream and
Research track positions are not able to accept IMG applications*

At present we have approximately 80 residents in the pediatric residency
program; 65 at the Vancouver site (4 in the Community Impact stream and 1 in
the Research Track), 8 at the Victoria site and 4 at the Fraser site.

# Program Curriculum

This residency program is for 4 years.

Program length of training does not exceed the Royal College or College of
Family Physicians of Canada standard.

The curriculum has been revised in accordance with the Royal College's
_Competence By Design_  required and recommended training experiences, and the
standards for accreditation for pediatrics as of July 2021.  The 4 stages of
CBD are mapped over 4 years, after which residents can choose to apply to a
subspecialty. The first three stages provide exposure to acute care and
ambulatory pediatrics as well as the subspecialties, with a graded
responsibility from junior to senior residency.  Residents participate in the
resident continuity clinic during Core and Transition to Practice stages.

  * Journal Club: bi-monthly meetings, 2 hours per meeting, usually off campus
  * Twice yearly resident retreats
  * Common courses (NRP, PALS, etc.)

  
**Research**

In order to fulfill the RCPSC objectives of training, each resident is
expected to work on a clinical, basic science, quality improvement or medical
education research project throughout the program and to present their work at
least once, either at the annual research day or at a conference. The Resident
Research Director runs the research program with a research committee and a
full-time scholarly activities coordinator.  First year residents take part in
a 24 hour research curriculum during the academic half day.

The resident Journal Club is scheduled bimonthly and introduces residents to
key clinical research methodologies. The Club is organized by the residents
and hosted by faculty members from different divisions in Pediatrics.

  
**Mandatory Courses**

The Department of Pediatrics schedules the NRP, PALS, Peds BASIC and AcORN
courses in the first and second years of resident training. Residents are also
required to complete ACLS, Residents as Teachers, and online courses including
the Indigenous Cultural Competency Course and Immunization Pearls.  
  

### Night Float

A night float call system is used for the coverage of the clinical teaching
units (CTU) during the weeknights. Night float runs on alternating nights over
a two weeks period (6 to 7 call shifts) with cross covering residents filling
gaps. Several rotations (PICU, NICU, IN, etc.) continue to use a traditional
call schedule upholding Resident Doctors of BC call regulations.

**The Hospitals          **

Through their affiliation with the University of British Columbia, British
Columbia Children's and Women's Hospitals serve as the primary source of
pediatric training in the province.  The new Teck Acute Care Center opened in
late 2017.

British Columbia Children's Hospital (BCCH) is the only tertiary care
pediatric hospital in BC. The hospital also provides primary and secondary
pediatric care to the pediatric population in and around Vancouver.  Virtually
all medical and surgical sub-specialties are represented at this centre. There
is a total of 154 pediatric beds with approximately 7100 admissions per year.
The 18 bed Pediatric ICU has approximately 800 admissions per year. We have an
active pediatric cardio-thoracic surgery service.  British Columbia Children's
Hospital has a Pediatric Emergency Department with approximately 50,000 visits
per year. The Ambulatory Care Building hosts over 40 clinics,  seeing over
160,000 visits per year. There are active medical, surgical and psychiatric
daycare programs.  http://www.bcchildrens.ca/

 British Columbia Women's Hospital offers level 2 and 3 neonatal experience
with 60 neonatal beds and over 1100 admission to NICU each year, and the Sunny
Hill Health Centre for Children provides child development and rehabilitation
services, with 12 inpatient beds, and 12,000 ambulatory visits annually.

Residents also spend time in a number of other community hospitals in the
province, including Surrey Memorial Hospital, the Royal Inland Hospital in
Kamloops, Royal Columbian Hospital New Westminster, Abbotsford Regional
General Hospital, Nanaimo Regional General Hospital, University hospital of
Northern BC (Prince George), and Kelowna Regional General Hospital.

**  
The University**

The Department of Pediatrics, part of the University of British Columbia's
Faculty of Medicine, has played a vital role in developing undergraduate and
postgraduate clinical training programs since 1952. The strength of the
Department lies in three areas: teaching, research, and exemplary patient
care. We are fully accredited by the Royal College of  Physicians and Surgeons
of Canada.  In addition, most subspecialties offer Royal College accredited
training programs for pediatric graduates, with approximately 80 subspecialty
residents and fellows per year.  https://pediatrics.med.ubc.ca/

# Additional Information

The UBC Pediatric residency program provides each resident with an education
stipend to attend and/or present at conferences, purchase textbooks and offset
other educational expenses during their training.  
  
Both individual and group mentorship programs exist. All residents are matched
to a multi-year mentorship group. The resident group provides peer mentorship
for incoming R1s, helping to support the transition into a new and challenging
residency program.  
  
In the summer, we welcome our new trainees with a Garden Party. Our Annual
Awards Banquet in June is a time to honour and celebrate the accomplishments
of our residents, fellows and faculty members.

### A little bit about Vancouver ...

The City of Vancouver is situated on the unceeded traditional territories of
the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), Sḵwx̱wú7mesh (Squamish), and səlilwətaɬ (Tsleil-
Waututh) Nations. It is one of North America's most beautiful cities, hosting
a natural harbor, mountains, forests, and beaches. The city has a mild
maritime climate, yet it is in close proximity to snow-capped mountains and
outdoor winter activities while the Pacific Ocean is most suited for sailing,
sea- kayaking, swimming, diving and windsurfing.  Vancouverites enjoy a
vibrant, multicultural city with a plethora of international restaurants.

Public transit is available throughout the lower mainland by bus, sea bus, and
sky train. The Canada Line connects Richmond to downtown Vancouver and runs
along the Cambie Street Corridor.  From the stop at Cambie Street and 25th
Avenue (King Edward) it is a 10 minute walk to BC Children's Hospital.
Travellers can take bikes on public transit.

Bicycling is a key year-round form of transport, with over 1,400 km of bike
routes (400 km on shared roadways with cars) throughout the Vancouver area.
The Central Valley Greenway, a 24 km pathway for cycling, jogging, walking,
skateboarding, blading and for those with wheelchairs, is a major
transportation and recreation route that links to multiple destinations across
the city.
