# Selection Criteria

Applicants must submit an application to each site they are interested in and
should assign the same set of documents to each site. Selection is based on
file review and one set of MMI interviews. Each file is reviewed and given a
score. This file review score determines whether a candidate is offered an
interview. The file review score is then combined with the interview score and
FMPROC score to create a total score for each applicant. **The file review
score will contribute to 20%, interview score will contribute to 75%, and
FMProC  will contribute to 5% of the overall global score**. A recommended
rank list based on the total score is submitted to each site for
consideration. The sites retain discretion to adjust the recommended rank list
based on local site selection committee input.

INDIGENOUS SITE SPECIFIC RANKING PROCESS:  
Our site has a unique mandate to train family physicians who will work in a

support health and wellness.  
  
Due to our unique mandate and our responsibility to our community partners it
is important that we select candidates who have a sincere desire to work in
Indigenous communities and who are culturally safe.  
  
We have created a scoring system to determine suitability to our site. A score
of 0 - 10 is assigned (0 = weak, 10= strong) based on:  
● personal letter (0-2 points)  
● lived Indigenous experience (0-2 point)  
● sincere interest in training at the Indigenous site (0-2 point)  
● relationship with Indigenous people and communities (0-4 points)  
  
The UBC central program sends us the list of students who selected our site
and completed the application process. Applicants on this list are ranked by a
selection committee using the Indigenous site specific criteria outlined below
with scores ranging between 0 and 10.  
Where there are applicants with the same score, Indigenous applicants will be
prioritized and the remaining order will be determined by the overall UBC
ranking.  
  
The Indigenous Family Practice Residency Site may elect not to rank candidates
if they feel that they are not suited to the site based on red ﬂags (generally
related to culturally unsafe language or behavior) or a poor site specific
suitability score. See bottom of this website under “Additional Information”
for details on site specific ranking.

# Program Highlights

### **Uniquely B.C:  UBC Family Medicine**

[Family Medicine training in BC](https://postgrad.familypractice.ubc.ca/)
presents you with many unique opportunities. We are a fully accredited
distributed program with 23 training sites and multiple training communities.
In an effort to meet the evolving needs of our society, each site provides a
solid foundation in the knowledge and clinical skills of Family Medicine so
that our graduates are prepared to practice in a variety of settings. While
our program offers diversity of training, it is based on [common goals,
learning objectives, and assessment
standards](https://postgrad.familymed.ubc.ca/program-info/).

All residents are required to do a [mandatory 2-month rural
rotation](https://postgrad.familymed.ubc.ca/resident-resources/rural-
rotation/) in Family Medicine in their second year. Residents in the Coastal,
or rural programs in the Okanagan or the North complete longer rural
placements. Residents can also apply to participate in Enhanced Rural training
for a total of 4-6 months in rural communities.

There is extensive [academic and administrative
support](https://postgrad.familymed.ubc.ca/about/program-matrix/) for the
entire residency program. Our central program administrative team is based in
Vancouver on UBC campus. At the site level, leadership teams are made up of a
Site Director, Site Faculty, Lead Residents and administrators. Lead Program
Faculty provide provincial education support in the areas of curriculum,
assessment, faculty development, scholarship and behavioral medicine.

The Family Practice Postgraduate Education Committee has representation from
all sites to ensure a connected, distributed program that fully meets
accreditation standards. Residents are represented at all levels of
governance.

A wide range of amazing recreational and cultural opportunities are at your
doorstep, as well as a collegial community of residents and physicians with
whom you can learn, grow, and play. We want your experience to be in BC to be
a positive and enjoyable one.

residents throughout the course of the training.

All UBC programs are allocated a fixed amount of funding per resident for
Resident Activities.  This funding is used to provide educational support to
residents during their 2 years of training. This includes funding for
residents to attend program-wide courses and events. Additionally, residents
may identify conferences and educational materials that would supplement their
training experience. A discretionary, per resident funding will also be
allocated to the sites for a similar purpose at the site level.

# Program Curriculum

This residency program is for 2 years.

Program length of training does not exceed the Royal College or College of
Family Physicians of Canada standard.

**Introduction**

This site provides opportunities to develop special expertise in providing
safe and appropriate care with and for Indigenous peoples for both Indigenous
and non-Indigenous allied physicians. Please note that this site is
administered centrally as part of the Indigenous Family Medicine program
together with Indigenous – Lower Mainland and Indigenous – Victoria.
Information regarding these other specific sites can be found under a separate
CaRMS description.

Our program is relationship-based and engaged with Indigenous communities. We
work in collaboration with a number of Indigenous communities and their health
care teams to provide educational experiences whereby residents are connected
within an Indigenous community for the duration of their training.  The
residents are welcomed and encouraged to participate in community activities
and gatherings in order to help them develop trust with the community they are
serving. Our program focuses on supporting residents to engage with
communities in a respectful way in order to learn about health and healing
with and from Indigenous peoples.

At the Indigenous – Rural Vancouver Island site, our residents have their home
clinics based in Stz'uminus/Snuneymuxw/Ladysmith.

**Indigenous Community Visits, Academic Curriculum, and Research**

New in 2025/26, our Indigenous Family Practice program will be administering
our own academic curriculum. Previously, our curriculum has been administered
by partnered sites such as Victoria.

Our curriculum is structured into academic weeks, and clinically focused
sessions will include lectures, case-based learning, SIM sessions, hands-on
clinical/procedural skills workshops, and exam prep. A highlight of our site
is our focus on relationship to each other and the Indigenous communities we
serve, and a focus of our academic gatherings is on incorporating Indigenous
ceremony and knowledge, community visits and activities, and meetings with
Elders and knowledge keepers. We will also have a focus on resident wellness
built into our curriculum.

We will have 6 academic weeks scheduled throughout the year. Some weeks will
be in-person and some will be virtual. Please note that since we are a
distributed program, attendance will require travel which will be reimbursed.
Expect to travel a minimum of three times per year for academic/scholarship
related travel.

Research requirements are consistent with other sites at UBC. In R1 a small
research or quality improvement project is to be completed, either
individually or with another resident. In R2, a larger scholar project must be
completed, and will be presented at our Indigenous Scholarship presentation at
the end of residency.



**International Electives**

Residents can do one month of interprovincial or international electives
during their training.



**Further Training**

Third year training positions are available in the area of Emergency Medicine,
Care of The Elderly, Anesthesia, Palliative Medicine, Sports and Exercise
Medicine, Clinician Scholars program and a wide range of other category 2
Enhanced Skills programs.

*Due to colonialism there are many ways our connection to community and kinship ties have been disrupted. We also recognize that there are different ways we form community because of this. If this is your experience we encourage you to outline this in our site-specific personal letter or reach out by email/phone (if this is something you’re comfortable doing). Our intention is not to further isolate and segregate our community.
