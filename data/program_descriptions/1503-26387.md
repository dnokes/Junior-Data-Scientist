file review and one set of MMI interviews. Each file is reviewed and given a
score. This file review score determines whether a candidate is offered an
interview. The file review score is then combined with the interview score and
FMPROC score to create a total score for each applicant. **The file review
score will contribute to 20%, interview score will contribute to 75%, and
FMProC  will contribute to 5% of the overall global score**. A recommended
rank list based on the total score is submitted to each site for
consideration. The sites retain discretion to adjust the recommended rank list
based on local site selection committee input.

In an effort to meet the evolving needs of our society, each site provides a

All residents are required to do a [mandatory 2-month rural
rotation](https://postgrad.familymed.ubc.ca/resident-resources/rural-

or rural programs in the Okanagan or the North complete longer rural
placements. Residents can also apply to participate in Enhanced Rural training
for a total of 4-6 months in rural communities.

There is extensive [academic and administrative
support](https://postgrad.familymed.ubc.ca/about/program-matrix/) for the
entire residency program. Our central program administrative team is based in
Vancouver on UBC campus. At the site level, leadership teams are made up of a
Site Director, Site Faculty, Lead Residents and administrators. Lead Program
Faculty provide provincial education support in the areas of curriculum,
assessment, faculty development, scholarship and behavioral medicine.

The Family Practice Postgraduate Education Committee has representation from
all sites to ensure a connected, distributed program that fully meets
accreditation standards. Residents are represented at all levels of
governance.

All UBC programs are allocated a fixed amount of funding per resident for
Resident Activities.  This funding is used to provide educational support to
residents during their 2 years of training. This includes funding for
residents to attend program-wide courses and events. Additionally, residents
may identify conferences and educational materials that would supplement their
training experience. A discretionary, per resident funding will also be
allocated to the sites for a similar purpose at the site level.

# Program Curriculum

This residency program is for 2 years.

Program length of training does not exceed the Royal College or College of
Family Physicians of Canada standard.

Kamloops is a hidden gem in south central British Columbia that must be
experienced.

Our program will provide a strong clinical and academic experience. Residents
will be immersed in comprehensive clinical experiences from the office, to the
community, hospital, hospice, long term care homes and surrounding rural and
indigenous communities. We are committed to excellence in teaching and care
for our patients and community. Communication and leadership, respect for
diversity and balance, and a keen interest in ongoing learning are all core to
our site faculty philosophy.

Residents are linked with 1-2 community practices and the UBC Family Practice
Learning Centre, a team based resident run teaching clinic. We have a cohesive
medical community with strong specialist consultants committed to family
practice training. In Kamloops residents will work closely with the entire
health care team.

There are opportunities for many diverse experiences. There are numerous rural
communities in our catchment area providing a strong rural influence in our
program. Addiction medicine, chronic pain, team psychiatric/medical care for
underserviced populations, palliative care, aboriginal care, geriatrics,
emergency/trauma and student health are all either integrated into the program
or available as electives. Some of our family practitioners provide
comprehensive obstetrical and family practice inpatient care. We also have new
women’s health and gender affirming care opportunities.

Health care is changing rapidly. Our site faculty is part of strong medical
leadership groups that help shape an exciting future for family medicine.

This is the place for comprehensive family practice training. We will provide
you with a strong foundation for your future family practice professional
career.



**Purpose/Objectives**

Our vision is to provide a comprehensive family practice residency program
that inspires residents, medical staff and health care system innovation.

impressive breadth of specialty services in Kamloops, while providing a
