# General Instructions

Program application language: English

We ask that candidates to the UBC Program apply to each of the distributed
Site Programs separately.  For clarity, these are: Vancouver, Fraser,
Vancouver Island, and Interior sites.

All documents/submissions including a separate personal letter for each site
should be submitted as requested.

A separate candidate rank order list is completed by each site, and candidates
are able to rank each site individually.

It is important to note that while CaRMS considers the four sites to be
separate programs for ranking purposes, the UBC program acts together when
selecting candidates for interview; i.e. there is only **one** interview that
covers all four sites. **CANDIDATES THAT DO NOT APPLY TO ALL FOUR SITES ARE
LESS LIKELY TO BE INVITED FOR AN INTERVIEW** as preference is given to
applicants who apply to all sites.

# Program Highlights

# **Vancouver Island**

#### **_The Victoria hospitals are located on the traditional and unceded
territory of the lək̓ʷəŋən (Lekwungen) speaking peoples, who include the
Esquimalt, Songhees, and W̱SÁNEĆ nations._**

The UBC Vancouver Island Emergency Medicine program offers excellent medical
training that is fully supported by the broader UBC program, while living on
the Island provides an amazing West Coast lifestyle.

At the Vancouver Island site, you’ll benefit from a tight-knit residency
group, one-to-one preceptorship while on shift, a wealth of hands-on training
experiences, and early clinical leadership. The program is based at the
Victoria General (VGH) and Royal Jubilee Hospitals (RJH) in Victoria – each
with a wide variety of patient demographics, pathology, and acuity. We
regularly see pediatrics in the ED as VGH is the region's dedicated pediatric
hospital and the main referral centre for the Island; VGH is also the Level 2
trauma referral center for all of Vancouver Island. Our Emergency Medicine
program is well regarded within the hospitals and the collegial atmosphere
makes for exceptional interdisciplinary teaching. Victoria is home to only a
small number of other residency programs which leads to more learning
opportunities per resident, and having the Island Medical Program (a
distributed site of the UBC medical school) in Victoria gives residents the
opportunity to teach and mentor.

The group of Emergency Physicians in Victoria take great pride in the
residency program, and are heavily involved in on-shift teaching, academic
days, and simulation. The close relationships you develop early on with our
physician group means that you will quickly be pulled into interesting cases,
even when off service. In addition, our group of physicians have a breadth of
experience ranging from trauma, critical care, prehospital care, ultrasound,
and clinical epidemiology to addictions, pediatrics, disaster medicine,
geriatrics, palliative care, and wilderness medicine allowing you to further
develop expertise across a wide array of Emergency Medicine topics.

## **Lifestyle**

Victoria is the capital city of British Columbia, and it’s renowned for its
scenic views, outdoor activities, historic buildings, lively culture, and
temperate weather. In addition to living next to the ocean and looking out at
mountain vistas, there is no shortage of restaurants, cafes, craft breweries,
shopping, theatre, music, and community events. Victoria also serves as a
launch point to explore the rest of Vancouver Island. Whether you’re
interested in watching the sunset along the West Coast Trail, surfing in
world-renowned Tofino, hitting the slopes at Mount Washington ski resort,
mountain biking in Cumberland, or hiking among giant Douglas firs, amazing
outdoor activities are never too far away.

The city is medium in size but has nearly everything you can find in a larger
metropolitan area. In addition, the city serves as a major tourism hub for
travelers from around the world and draws approximately 3.5 million visitors
per year.

Not only is Victoria one of the most beautiful places to call home in Canada,
completing your 5 years of training on Vancouver Island will give you the
skills and confidence to practice Emergency Medicine anywhere.

# Program Curriculum

This residency program is for 5 years.

Program length of training does not exceed the Royal College or College of
Family Physicians of Canada standard.

  * Academic Full Day
    * Academic Full Day occurs every Wednesday – this time is call protected for academic teaching conducted by staff physicians and fellow residents.
    * Many of the sessions are held via videoconference across all 4 sites while some are taught locally at each site.
    * Academic Sessions include:
      * Foundations (PGY-1) and Core (PGY-2-4) seminars – these are based on Rosen’s Emergency Medicine textbook
      * Grand rounds – these include resident and staff presentations in a formal podium style across all sites
      * Patient Safety and Quality Rounds – these include resident led presentations on local cases that were identified as Quality Improvement and system change opportunities.
      * ECG and Radiology teaching sessions – these are typically given by fellow residents in a quiz and case based format.
  * Simulation Training (SIM)
    * UBC has a history of an outstanding simulation program. This was highlighted in our recent accreditation as being a major program strength.
    * Our program has adapted to Competency Based Medical Education with simulation cases targeted to specific Entrustable Professional Activities.
    * Each UBC site runs its own resident simulation program and lab. This allows each group of residents to get individualized and personal attention. There is significant communication and sharing of resources across the sites.  
    * Simulation is an area of educational innovation at UBC with all sites using In-Situ simulation as a basis for ED continuous quality improvement and health care team collaboration. Residents are routinely involved in these rich educational experiences. 
  * Journal Club
    * Journal Club is held monthly at a staff physician’s home -- typically with lots of food to feed the hungry residents after their work days! 
    * There is one session for the Lower Mainland residents, and one each for Kelowna and Victoria
    * Articles are presented and critiqued by residents on a rotating basis with the assistance of a biostatistical expert staff physician.
  * NERD (Novel Education in Research Design)
    * Vancouver serves as the host site for UBC residents from all 4 sites (typically during PGY-2) to gather for this block-length course.
    * **NERD aims to increase resident knowledge about the conduct of various types of research projects as well as the optimal consumption of research findings as a practicing physician. The block also serves to create and improve resident/faculty research collaborations and guide resident scholarly output.   **
    * Residents are provided with guidance to develop their own scholarly projects, explore the diversity of UBC EM research, connect with staff physicians with research expertise, and develop future collaborations.
  * Scholarly Project
    * As mandated by the Royal College, residents "must complete a scholarly research, quality/patient safety or educational project relevant to Emergency Medicine that is documented in a manner that is suitable for submission to a peer reviewed publication or oral presentation at an academic meeting."
    * Residents are given opportunities and support to pursue their own projects or to join with ongoing work by our faculty.
  * Ultrasound Training
    * All PGY-1 UBC residents come to the Vancouver program site in July for an introductory ultrasound course.
    * During PGY-1, there is also a dedicated **ultrasound block held at each program site to achieve** proficiency in simple and advanced ultrasound scanning skills.
  * Practice examinations
    * Residents write the Canadian In Training Exam (CITE) every fall and winter.
    * Results are aggregated across Canada so residents can benchmark their progress with their cohort.
    * Practice oral examinations are held frequently during the year and led by local staff physicians.  Residents participate with increasing frequency as they become more senior.
  * Ethics/Professionalism & Communication Seminar Series
    * Led by an Emergency Physician with training and expertise in medical ethics, these seminars are tailored to resident level of training and take place in a small group discussion format. Topics and cases are reviewed with a focus on ethical issues in clinical medicine as well as professionalism and communication skills.
  * Continuous Quality Improvement Training
    * Residents learn about CQI from emergency physicians with expertise in this area. Seminars and online modules are completed throughout PGY-1 and 2 with specific workshops and projects planned for PGY-5. In addition, residents are involved across the UBC sites in local Patient Safety and Quality case reviews and discussions.
  * Emergency Medicine Specialized Skills
    * Each site delivers hands-on sessions in airway management, casting, slit lamp use, procedures and other relevant skills. These occur throughout the curriculum using expertise across the UBC sites to deliver smaller group practical sessions. The program runs a cadaver procedure lab every two years providing an opportunity to practice high acuity/low occurrence (HALO) procedures such as thoracotomy and surgical airways. 

**Academic Funding**  

To supplement the residents' educational experience during their training at
UBC, each year residents are provided with,

  * Up to $1400 (pro-rated to UBC's fiscal year) from UBC for residents to attend program-wide courses, conferences, purchase educational materials, academic and wellbeing events (such as resident retreats)
  * $500 from their site Emergency Physicians Group for academic related expenses such as textbooks, courses and electronics.
