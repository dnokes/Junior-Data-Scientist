# Selection Criteria

## Program goals

The Dalhousie Department of Family Medicine's program goal is to train
residents to be family physicians who through education, research,
comprehensive clinical care, and engagement in partnerships, meet the needs of
Maritime communities.  Residents are trained to address health needs of all
populations including underserved communities and individuals with complex
needs, giving them the ability to practice in diverse family practice
settings.  

Our program and university value the importance of equity, diversity and
inclusion (EDI) in residency education, and achieving a diverse and inclusive
group of residents is a goal in our selection process. The CaRMS Self
Identification Questionnaire advances diversity and inclusivity within the
residency program.

                                                 

## Selection process goals

As a program we are looking for applicants with solid people skills, a variety
of life experiences, an admirable work ethic and reasonable academic
background. We look for evidence of commitment to family medicine in your
personal letter. We are interested in candidates who are comfortable with
self-directed learning, with teamwork, with seeking out the countless learning
opportunities available, and with an interest in an appropriate balance
between personal life, family, community and professional life.

Dalhousie is committed to fostering a collegial culture grounded in diversity
and inclusiveness. The university encourages applications from Indigenous
persons, persons with a disability, racialized persons, women, persons of a
minority sexual orientation and/or gender identity, and all candidates who
would contribute to the diversity of our community.

Candidates are not required to submit the CaRMS Self Identification
questionnaire or to complete the verification process for Indigenous identity,
membership, or citizenship, but for those that do feel comfortable doing so
the information received would only be used to advantage those who would
contribute to the diversity of our community.

Any self identification questionnaires received and the results of the
verification process will be reviewed as part of our file review process, and
used as an aid for file reviewers in selecting a diverse group of candidates
for interviews. Information received may also be used by the program to adjust
final rankings, at the discretion of the selection committee, to address
issues of program priority and diversity.

# Program Highlights

**The Dalhousie Program - An Overview:**

Have you always wanted to learn in a community setting where family physicians
are respected and valued? If so, Dalhousie is the place for you. Teaching
residents and students in communities across the Maritimes has been the focus
of our Department from its beginnings. Our aim is to encourage residents to
become effective, compassionate family physicians who can care for their
patients in hospital, ambulatory and community settings. You will be able to
learn office practice, in-patient care, obstetrics, procedures and emergency
skills from family physicians who are skilled and experienced.

**_What support is available to residents in the program including rural
clinical learning experiences?_**

Residents are only expected to pay rent in one location. Thus, if a resident
has a lease or a mortgage, and the program requires them to live at another
site for a period of time, the cost of the rent is reimbursed to the resident.
Travel expenses are paid when a resident is required to move to a different
site for a core clinical learning experience. If residents are required to
travel to multiple sites during a core clinical learning experience, they are
reimbursed for the additional kilometres. Travel to and from work is not
reimbursed.

**_Are there opportunities for electives?_**

Residents in the Dalhousie University program can arrange up to four weeks of
their elective time outside of the Maritime Provinces. Other elective time
should be done in the Maritime Provinces.  Residents can apply to do more than
four weeks outside the Maritime Provinces for global health experiences.

**_What are the research requirements of the program?_**

A resident project is required during the residency. Residents receive
protected time for scholarly activity during the core family medicine clinical
learning experience to work on this project. It is also expected that the
residents will take advantage of any expertise available to them through their
community practice clinical learning experiences. The purpose of the resident
project is to introduce the resident to the process of finding answers to
questions commonly encountered in primary care by critically reviewing the
available literature. Where such answers are found lacking, the resident may
choose to employ an appropriate methodology to design a study using proper
scientific rigour, to answer that question.

**_What about ATLS, ALARM, ACLS and NRP?_**

Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS), Advances in Labour and Risk Management
(ALARM), Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS), Neonatal Resuscitation Program
(NRP) - **All residents are required to have ACLS prior to beginning
residency**. During the residency, all residents are funded to attend an ATLS
course, an ALARM course, an NRP course, and an ACLS refresher.

**_How do residents learn evidence-based medicine and research skills?_**

Current approaches to practising evidence-based medicine are taught through
patient and practice-based tutorials. Emphasis is on learning the skills to
seek the research evidence to support clinical decision-making.

**_What PGY3 positions are available?_**

There are PGY3 positions in Emergency Medicine, Palliative Care and Care of
the Elderly at Dalhousie. Individualized third year programs may also be
available at a resident's request and initiative and subject to funding
availability.

\----

**THE FREDERICTON PROGRAM - Introduction**  
---  
  |  The Fredericton program was established in 1994 and provides an opportunity to train in the community setting while having strong links to the academic centre.  Feedback from the residents and from program reviewers reveals three main strengths to our Program. First, the bulk of resident learning is 'hands-on', with exposure to a large number and variety of clinical situations and cases. Secondly, competition with other learners for clinical opportunities is rare. Almost all learners in Fredericton are family medicine residents on a service with only one resident. Thirdly, our teaching hospital and our teaching practices are not dependent on residents for service; therefore the focus is on education and not service. Self-directed residents will thrive in this learning environment. The Fredericton region (pop. 108,000 – 2021 Census) is served by the Dr. Everett Chalmers Regional Hospital. This hospital has 417 beds (including oﬀ-site Department of Veterans Aﬀairs and Addictions Unit). Family physicians play a major role in the care of medical inpatients palliative and rehabilitation patients. While there is a strong primary care presence, this hospital also oﬀers a wide range of specialty services, including but not limited to: neonatology and pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, cardiac care, intensive care, psychiatry, orthopedics, urology, ophthalmology, internal medicine, general surgery, vascular surgery and plastic surgery. There are also addictions, sexual health and tertiary rehabilitative Medicine programs in Fredericton. Observers have described two distinctive features of our hospital. First, they are impressed with the key role of family physicians in the hospital. Secondly, they note how well the specialists and the family physicians work together. **  
**THE FREDERICTON PROGRAM - Unique Features**  
  | 

  * The Fredericton site is one of Dalhousie Family Medicine’s distributed training sites, where training occurs outside of Halifax.
  * The Fredericton program is learner centred and provides hands-on, experiential learning.
  * Fredericton residents consistently do well on exams, and match regularly to third year positions at Dalhousie and elsewhere.
  * The Fredericton program has an excellent simulation curriculum and facilities. Residents will gain exposure to interprofessional care and high acuity scenarios in a safe learning environment. These are operated in collaboration with DMNB and Horizon Health

 **  
**THE FREDERICTON PROGRAM - Family Medicine Rotations**  
  |  There are 44 weeks of family medicine in our two year program.  A 4-week core clinical learning experience is completed at the very start of the residency allowing the residents and preceptors to work together to build a panel of patients and familiarize themselves with the practice setting.  A 12-week core clinical learning experience in Family Medicine is completed in the first year along with regularly scheduled 1/2 days back to preceptor's offices. In the second year, residents will spend 16 weeks with their core preceptors in addition to scheduled 1/2 days back. Each resident is assigned to one or a pair of family physicians and works exclusively in their practice. The resident is expected to participate in all areas of the practice.   Experiences include office practice, inpatient care, ER shifts, shared obstetrical care to 36 weeks gestation, OR assists, nursing home care, extramural hospital supervision, and home visits. Residents are exposed to large numbers of patients, covering a wide variety of illnesses and clinical settings.  A further 12 weeks in the second year is spent in a small community practice. There are approximately 30 community practices scattered all over the Maritimes from which to choose. A few of these rural practices are located near Fredericton for those who wish to commute. All of our family medicine clinical learning experiences use a preceptor model for patient care. Responsibility for patient care is gradually increased, so that by the end of two years, residents are managing 3-4 patients per hour in the office setting.  **  
**What is the ratio of residents to faculty?**  
  |  The Fredericton Program operates on a preceptor model so the normal ratio is one resident to one faculty member during all Family Medicine rotations. **  
**What is the average patient load per resident?**  
  |  The Fredericton Family Practices are very busy so residents see as many patients per day as their competence and conﬁdence and permits. Resident responsibilities increase over time along the continuum of graduated responsibility. Preceptors work closely with residents and over time begin to work along side. Family Medicine preceptors are always available to provide coaching. By the end of their training, residents are comfortable and capable of caring for 15-20 patients per day. **  
**What resources are available?**  
  |  Our Family Medicine Teaching Unit is a comfortable home for our residents and faculty located within the hospital. In it are located administrative and teaching facilities. The facility includes two seminar rooms, a resource center (library), computer access (e-mail and internet), videoconferencing technology and a well-equipped exercise room. There are also on-call rooms, lockers and a kitchen in the resident's area of the unit. Laptops and data projectors are available for residents to borrow when travelling or doing presentations. **

# Program Curriculum

This residency program is for 2 years.

Program length of training does not exceed the Royal College or College of
Family Physicians of Canada standard.



_Each year Dalhousie Family Medicine hosts a mandatory attendance curriculum
event - a Family Medicine Resident Education Weekend (FMREW).  Attendance for
all residents from all sites is required. Further information is provided to
residents. **Time off requests will not be approved during this period
excluding extenuating circumstances. FMREW 2025 will be held at the Algonquin
Resort in St. Andrews, NB on Wednesday, September 24 - Friday, September 26,
2025.**_  
  
Dalhousie Family Medicine sets our educational standards. These are derived
from the educational principles of the College of Family Physicians of Canada
(CFPC). Patient centered care and the four principles of family medicine are
central to our curriculum delivery. The curriculum is set by the Curriculum
Sub-Committee which includes members from all of Dalhousie Family Medicine's
teaching sites.  Our residents learn in three ways. First, experiential
learning is our hallmark. Secondly, there is ample opportunity for self-
directed learning, especially around a surprise or a question arising from a
case the resident has encountered. Thirdly, learning is supplemented by a
scheduled seminar series, presented over two years, but mainly during the core
family medicine rotations. Most seminars (some of which use the McMaster model
of problem-based learning) explore common problems in family medicine. Others
consider important issues such as practice management, medical-legal problems,
and bio-ethical dilemmas. Some topics are presented as part of a "core
curriculum" that come from our academic centre. Other seminar topics are
chosen because of a special interest or a need identified by a resident or
faculty member. Residents are also in journal clubs and have evidence based
topics presented by our faculty. The majority of academic teaching occurs on
Fridays.
