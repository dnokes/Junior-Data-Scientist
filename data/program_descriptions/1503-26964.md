# Program Curriculum

This residency program is for 5 years.

Program length of training does not exceed the Royal College or College of
Family Physicians of Canada standard.

**Academic Curriculum**

The academic curriculum has been modified with the implementation of
Competency By Design started in July 2020.  The residency program is divided
into 4 stages: Transition to Discipline, Foundations, Core (of Discipline) and
Transition to Practice.

Seminars in the first stage (duration of one month) will be an introduction to
the initial aspects of psychiatric practice including the basics of
psychiatric interviewing, diagnosis, formulation, and basic management plan.
The Foundations stage which will subsume the remainder of PGY1 and all PGY2,
will attend to the foundational aspects of general psychiatry. The morning
curriculum for the PGY2 Residents is designed to provide a comprehensive
introduction to General Adult Psychiatry, with the initial two-month block
being a seminar series covering Psychopharmacology and Emergency Psychiatry.
The last two months will give a general introduction to Child and Adolescent
and Geriatric Psychiatry in preparation for PGY3.

In Core (PGY3 and 4), didactic teaching relates to more complex syndromes and
alternate demographics. The focus for the first half of PGY3 is a more in
depth look at Child and Adolescent and Geriatric Psychiatry. The latter half
of the PGY3 curriculum is designed to provide residents with a more in-depth
knowledge of the major clinical syndromes and learn about special areas in
psychiatry including Consultation-Liaison, Forensic Psychiatry, Reproductive
Psychiatry, etc. salient for the Royal College Exams.  The majority of PGY4
academic days will be reserved for study time, Mock OSCE practice sessions and
with some review lectures geared towards exam preparation.

The Royal College exams will occur at the end of the Core Stage (end of PGY4)
leaving the Transition to Practice PGY5 Residents with some clinical
flexibility, a series of seminars aimed towards preparation for clinical
practice as well as didactic lectures that are more clinically rather than
exam relevant.

The academic program is designed to meet the standards of the Royal College of
Physicians and Surgeons of Canada.

Academic seminars are held for a full day each Thursday for the Residents at
the PGY2 and PGY3 training levels often with several hours at the end of each,
as flex time to use for personal needs or to attend to other Royal College
requirements (eg psychotherapy or Scholarly project). The Psychiatry academic
day for PGY1 Residents is provided monthly at the home program. PGY1 Residents
are excused from their clinical responsibilities for the day to attend this
integrated series of seminars covering fundamental aspects of psychiatry.

There is a comprehensive Psychotherapy curriculum covering a number of
validated treatment modalities which runs on Thursday afternoons; in the PGY2
year this covers basic psychotherapy skills and increases in complexity and
diversity in the PGY3 and initial part of the PGY4 years.

**Clinical rotations mandated by the Royal College of Physicians & Surgeons of
Canada**

Training in empirically supported psychotherapeutic approaches. This must
involve 2 years of weekly longitudinal psychodynamic psychotherapy, a minimum
of 4-6 months of weekly CBT+IPT and a minimum of 4-6 months of both family and
group psychotherapy. Training in empirically supported psychotherapeutic
approaches must be documented and evaluated separately from other rotations.

**PGY1 (Transition to Discipline and Foundations)**

Training occurs at St. Paul's Hospital or Royal Columbian Hospital.
Assignments to SPH and RCH sites are made by the UBC Psychiatry Postgraduate
Education office based on ballots filled out by the Resident (each is asked to
rank two sites in order of preference). There is coordination between the PGY1
Training Directors at each hospital site and the Residency Program Directors.
The initial month-long Transition to Discipline rotation will occur in a
Psychiatry setting, to complete the initial two Entrustable Professional
Activities (EPA’s). Rotations then differ somewhat between the training sites,
but all will include: one block of Internal Medicine, Family Medicine,
Pediatrics, Neurology, Emergency Medicine, Addictions, Emergency Psychiatry,
an Elective, two blocks of Selectives and 2 additional blocks of Psychiatry.

**PGY2 (Foundations)**

Training consists of twelve months of Adult Psychiatry six months in an
inpatient and six months in an outpatient setting and occurs at one of the
following hospitals: Vancouver General Hospital, UBC Hospital (Research
Track), Richmond Hospital, St. Paul's Hospital, and Lion's Gate Hospital.

**PGY3 (Core)**

Training consists of six months of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry at: BC
Children's & Women's Hospital alone or in combination with Richmond Hospital;
and six months of Geriatric Psychiatry at one of four sites: Mt. St.
Joseph's/St. Paul’s Hospital, Richmond Hospital, Vancouver General Hospital or
Lion's Gate Hospital.

**PGY4 (Core)**

Training consists of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry, Addiction Psychiatry,
Emergency Psychiatry, Chronic Care Psychiatry and one elective.  Training is
not restricted to the home track but can occur in any track across the
province on a first come first serve basis, and there can be consideration of
a rotation out of province under special circumstances.

**PGY5 (Transition to Practice)**

During this period the resident assumes more leadership in the education and
supervision of junior colleagues while consolidating and further developing a
career track interest through electives and selectives including research.

Training consists of six months each of Selectives and Electives. Selectives
are limited to child & adolescent psychiatry; geriatric psychiatry; forensic
psychiatry; psychosomatic medicine; psychiatric research; the psychotherapies;
addictions; developmental disabilities and psychiatry in rural and/or remote
locations. Electives could involve any aspect of training relevant to
contemporary psychiatric practice, including research as approved by the
residency training committee. Electives may consist of an approved rotation in
internal medicine, neurology, or other branch of medicine relevant to
psychiatry.  There is also consideration for electives to be done out of
province or out of country with approval.

**Electives/Selectives**

A wide variety of electives are offered along with flexibility in splitting
these electives and/or arranging new ones. There are opportunities to spend
all or part of the elective year in an approved residency program anywhere in
North America or abroad in the following areas:

Geriatric Psychiatry - 2-year program beginning in PGY5

Forensic Psychiatry - 1-year program in PGY6

**Research**

Emphasis is placed on research throughout the program and is required through
the following process:

With the help of the Oversight Director of Research and Scholarly Activity,
Dr. Erin Michalak, and Scholarly Activity Supervisor for Vancouver Track, Dr.
Donna Lang, residents are required to be involved in a scholarly activity from
the onset of their training. Dr. Michalak's designate in different tracks
facilitates liaison between residents and specific research mentors and
assists them with new and ongoing research projects, writing up cases, and
literature reviews.

There are 2 CaRMS matched Research Track positions which allow for 1 day per
week of protected research time in PGY2-5 years.

Non-Research Track residents may apply for ½ day per week for a more complex
research project at any time from their PGY2 year on until its completion.

Annual Research Day: Residents are able to present their work and the
department awards prizes for the best clinical and basic science papers
submitted by residents.

Any resident may apply for permission to do six or twelve months in a research
selective in their final year.

Opportunities for research exist in many areas of clinical and basic science
practice.
