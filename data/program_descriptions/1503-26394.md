# Selection Criteria

Applicants must submit an application to each site they are interested in and
should assign the same set of documents to each site. Selection is based on
file review and one set of MMI interviews. Each file is reviewed and given a
score. This file review score determines whether a candidate is offered an
interview. The file review score is then combined with the interview score and
FMPROC score to create a total score for each applicant. **The file review
score will contribute to 20%, interview score will contribute to 75%, and
FMProC  will contribute to 5% of the overall global score**. A recommended
rank list based on the total score is submitted to each site for
consideration. The sites retain discretion to adjust the recommended rank list
based on local site selection committee input.

# Program Highlights

### **Uniquely B.C:  UBC Family Medicine**

[Family Medicine training in BC](https://postgrad.familypractice.ubc.ca/)
presents you with many unique opportunities. We are a fully accredited
distributed program with 23 training sites and multiple training communities.
In an effort to meet the evolving needs of our society, each site provides a
solid foundation in the knowledge and clinical skills of Family Medicine so
that our graduates are prepared to practice in a variety of settings. While
our program offers diversity of training, it is based on [common goals,
learning objectives, and assessment
standards](https://postgrad.familymed.ubc.ca/program-info/).

All residents are required to do a [mandatory 2-month rural
rotation](https://postgrad.familymed.ubc.ca/resident-resources/rural-
rotation/) in Family Medicine in their second year. Residents in the Coastal,
or rural programs in the Okanagan or the North complete longer rural
placements. Residents can also apply to participate in Enhanced Rural training
for a total of 4-6 months in rural communities.

There is extensive [academic and administrative
support](https://postgrad.familymed.ubc.ca/about/program-matrix/) for the
entire residency program. Our central program administrative team is based in
Vancouver on UBC campus. At the site level, leadership teams are made up of a
Site Director, Site Faculty, Lead Residents and administrators. Lead Program
Faculty provide provincial education support in the areas of curriculum,
assessment, faculty development, scholarship and behavioral medicine.

The Family Practice Postgraduate Education Committee has representation from
all sites to ensure a connected, distributed program that fully meets
accreditation standards. Residents are represented at all levels of
governance.

A wide range of amazing recreational and cultural opportunities are at your
doorstep, as well as a collegial community of residents and physicians with
whom you can learn, grow, and play. We want your experience to be in BC to be
a positive and enjoyable one.

residents throughout the course of the training.

All UBC programs are allocated a fixed amount of funding per resident for
Resident Activities.  This funding is used to provide educational support to
residents during their 2 years of training. This includes funding for
residents to attend program-wide courses and events. Additionally, residents
may identify conferences and educational materials that would supplement their
training experience. A discretionary, per resident funding will also be
allocated to the sites for a similar purpose at the site level.

# Program Curriculum

This residency program is for 2 years.

Program length of training does not exceed the Royal College or College of
Family Physicians of Canada standard.

**Introduction**

Welcome to UBC’s Northern Rural Site, anchored in Prince George for R1
followed by immersion-style rural rotations (2 four-month blocks) and
electives (4 one-month blocks) across the province in R2. This training
program is designed to prepare you for full-service family medicine, rural
locuming or enhanced skills training, with a heavy bias toward rural
generalism. You will experience a breadth of medicine and surgery, applicable
to full service practice, while participating in regular call of varying
intensity. These two short years are not designed to be exhaustive but have
been shaped to achieve competency and confidence.



Our program is uniquely positioned in the North to provide block-based
rotations in R1 at a regional referral hospital (with a generous compliment of
specialists) while offering robust rural selectives, rotations and first-hand
experiences. We believe in work life balance, but to play hard, some hard work
is needed as well.



**Consider our site if you:**

  * See rural practice or locums in your future
  * Enjoy the outdoors in all four seasons
  * Are interested in authentic family medicine training which will prepare you for a variety of practice types
  * Want the ability to transition directly into northern or rural practice.



**Please do not consider our site if you:**

  * Are looking for no-call
  * Do not wish to live in the North for at least the duration of residency
  * Are interested in urban based “referral style” medicine



We have a co-site director model shared between James Card and Bron
Finkelstein, both rural family physicians who trained through the Prince
George site. Autonomy, self-efficacy and professionalism are key tenets of our
site, with the pursuit of individual interests strongly encouraged.

# Training Sites

**Location**

The first year of the Northern Rural Program is spent in Prince George, a city
of 80,000 serving the majority of Northern BC. The referral area is
approximately 250,000. It is located in the geographic centre of British
Columbia, 800 km from Vancouver, Edmonton, Kelowna and Calgary. The population
is young and the economic base is in forestry and servicing the northern
region.  
  
Lakes and rivers abound with excellent summer opportunities to kayak, hike,
canoe, fish or just swim. There is an extensive network of trails within the
city for running and mountain biking. Winter activities include a range from
cross-country skiing (classic or skate), hockey and speed skating. The
surrounding area affords easy access to the mountains for camping,
backpacking, downhill or backcountry skiing. Prince George is home to the
Cougars (a Junior A hockey team), a symphony orchestra and an excellent semi-
professional theater.  We are fortunate to have the beautiful University of
Northern BC campus located in Prince George. The UNBC Medical School opened
its doors in 2004 and graduated its first class in 2008. Current alumni

Prince George is an area where housing is affordable, the commute is short,
and there are endless recreational opportunities at your doorstep. It provides
a great opportunity for optimal work-life balance. For those with connections

First year residents join their Prince George colleagues for the Prince George
based curriculum.  The University Hospital of Northern BC is a tertiary care
hospital and is the major referral center for Northern BC.  A  Cancer Clinic
which offers medical and radiation treatment opened in 2012. A Learning Center
was opened in spring of 2015 which expanded our teaching and meeting
facilities significantly and provided a new and improved location for our SIM
lab.

The 201 acute beds include 10 ICU/CCU beds, 8 NICU beds and a dedicated
clinical teaching unit for Internal Medicine and Pediatrics.  The Emergency
department treats 46,000 patients annually making it one of the busiest
emergency departments in the province. The department is the only dedicated
trauma center for the North with 2 dedicated trauma bays, 16 acute care beds
and a minor treatment unit.  Family Physicians remain highly involved with
both inpatient and Emergency care.

9 general surgeons and 7 orthopaedic specialists perform 2500 surgical
procedures annually.  There is a busy ambulatory outpatient department with an
endoscopy suite and rooms for outpatient minor surgery.

The majority of the 1040 deliveries annually are managed by Family Physicians
and midwives.  This active unit is capable of managing high risk or
complicated deliveries with obstetricians and paediatricians providing
consultant care.

Family Practice teaching has been centered in a purpose built, free standing
clinic within a two minute walk to the hospital.  The clinic houses the
majority of our Family Physician preceptors, serving 16,000 patients.  In
2014, we expanded to include community offices with additional preceptors.
All practices use electronic medical records and are connected to the hospital
systems allowing for access to all laboratory and radiology results.  All
practices continue to embrace leading edge practice solutions such as group
visits, multidisciplinary care from a primary care home and integrated health
strategies, ever encouraged by the Prince George Division of Family Practice.

Our Mission Statement says it all:  We are a group of supportive colleagues
working as skilled teachers and mentors, who model the diverse roles of FP’s
within a high quality Primary Care Home.  We foster clinical excellence and
shared leadership to produce competent, professional, Full Service Family
Doctors.
