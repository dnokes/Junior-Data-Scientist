# Selection Criteria

Applicants must submit an application to each site they are interested in and
should assign the same set of documents to each site. Selection is based on
file review and one set of MMI interviews. Each file is reviewed and given a
score. This file review score determines whether a candidate is offered an
interview. The file review score is then combined with the interview score and
FMPROC score to create a total score for each applicant. **The file review
score will contribute to 20%, interview score will contribute to 75%, and
FMProC  will contribute to 5% of the overall global score**. A recommended
rank list based on the total score is submitted to each site for
consideration. The sites retain discretion to adjust the recommended rank list
based on local site selection committee input.

# Program Highlights

### **Uniquely B.C:  UBC Family Medicine**

[Family Medicine training in BC](https://postgrad.familypractice.ubc.ca/)
presents you with many unique opportunities. We are a fully accredited
distributed program with 23 training sites and multiple training communities.
In an effort to meet the evolving needs of our society, each site provides a
solid foundation in the knowledge and clinical skills of Family Medicine so
that our graduates are prepared to practice in a variety of settings. While
our program offers diversity of training, it is based on [common goals,
learning objectives, and assessment
standards](https://postgrad.familymed.ubc.ca/program-info/).

All residents are required to do a [mandatory 2-month rural
rotation](https://postgrad.familymed.ubc.ca/resident-resources/rural-
rotation/) in Family Medicine in their second year. Residents in the Coastal,
or rural programs in the Okanagan or the North complete longer rural
placements. Residents can also apply to participate in Enhanced Rural training
for a total of 4-6 months in rural communities.

There is extensive [academic and administrative
support](https://postgrad.familymed.ubc.ca/about/program-matrix/) for the
entire residency program. Our central program administrative team is based in
Vancouver on UBC campus. At the site level, leadership teams are made up of a
Site Director, Site Faculty, Lead Residents and administrators. Lead Program
Faculty provide provincial education support in the areas of curriculum,
assessment, faculty development, scholarship and behavioral medicine.

The Family Practice Postgraduate Education Committee has representation from
all sites to ensure a connected, distributed program that fully meets
accreditation standards. Residents are represented at all levels of
governance.

A wide range of amazing recreational and cultural opportunities are at your
doorstep, as well as a collegial community of residents and physicians with
whom you can learn, grow, and play. We want your experience to be in BC to be
a positive and enjoyable one.

[resources](https://postgrad.familymed.ubc.ca/resident-resources/resident-
wellness-and-safety/) have been developed by our program to support our
residents throughout the course of the training.

All UBC programs are allocated a fixed amount of funding per resident for
Resident Activities.  This funding is used to provide educational support to
residents during their 2 years of training. This includes funding for
residents to attend program-wide courses and events. Additionally, residents
may identify conferences and educational materials that would supplement their
training experience. A discretionary, per resident funding will also be
allocated to the sites for a similar purpose at the site level.

* * *

# Program Curriculum

This residency program is for 2 years.

Program length of training does not exceed the Royal College or College of
Family Physicians of Canada standard.

**Introduction**

As a Family Physician community, we provide care to around 100,000 people from
Campbell River to the Comox Valley. Our community is rural, diverse, and rich
with recreational and cultural opportunities. The rewards for living and
working here are huge. Strathcona Park is one of the most beautiful back
yards. Summer or winter, mountain or ocean, the choice of activity is immense.
Our Site can support your drive to learn and become a complete rural Family
Physician and supports the opportunity to go out and have fun with family and
friends providing harmony to the challenge of work/life balance.

Campbell River is approx. 50km north of the Comox Valley (comprising the
communities of Courtenay & Comox). Our hospital care is based in the North
Island Hospital of Campbell River General Hospital (CRGH) and Comox Valley
Hospital (CVH).

When matched to our Site, we ask you to provide a short “bio”. This
information helps us match you to a community that supports your desires and
needs and becomes your “home community” for the next two years. We cannot
guarantee to meet requests to be placed in a particular community.

The majority of your clinical activity will occur within your “home community”
with some travel required for some specialist rotations, Academic Half Day SIM
sessions and other Academic Events.

We have 8 Residents currently in each teaching community of Campbell River and
Comox Valley (4 R2 and 4 R1) and will be increasing to an intake of 9 R1’s in
2024.

**‘Home’ Clinics & Preceptors**

You are placed with a Primary Preceptor who takes responsibility to
collaborate with you on planning your schedule and your evaluations.  You may
also be attached to a secondary Preceptor(s) either in the same clinic or a
nearby clinic.

An expectation is for you is to develop competence in all aspects of Family
Medicine care, from womb to tomb. It is unlikely that a preceptor practice
alone is able to provide that need and so we encourage a shared preceptor
model to achieve all the experiences required to develop competence in all
domains of care by design rather than by chance.  This multi preceptor model
also provides the opportunity to experience differing styles of preceptorship,
diverse office EMR familiarity, variety of staff and models of practice
including running an office and the ‘Business of medicine’.

**Site Ethos**

We offer a lot of flexibility to help create an experience which is unique
within the overarching program structure. We want you to realize your
potential as a Family Physician by identifying your leaning gaps and
addressing those needs locally through rotations and longitudinal experiences.
If we cannot deliver your needs locally, we identify together how and where
they may be met and utilize this through elective time.

We want you to embrace your medical passions to develop competence and
excellence. We want you to create strong foundations for your professional
identity as you progress from medical student to independent practitioner. We
want you to have fun learning by engaging in and defining your learning
experience.

Our Clinical Teaching Faculty are role models for rural family practice and
inspire our learners with the joys of community care. Our teachers create the
safe and rich learning environment in which you and our learners may flourish.
You are placed at the heart of your experience.

The shared goal of our Site and Teachers is to help you discover and develop
the best version of you as a rural Family Doctor.

Embrace the opportunity and enjoy the journey.

We Are Strathcona!

**PGY 1 Overview**

There are opportunities for you to manage your own patient population from the
beginning of residency training and to support the development of your
professional identity.

In July, when possible, you begin with a month in your home clinic and then
begin specialist rotations which occupies the majority of R1. Specialist
rotations include OB (8wks), Child and adolescent health (4 weeks), Mental
Health (4 weeks), Surgery (6 weeks), Addictions Medicine (2 weeks). Hospital
Medicine (12 weeks - 8 weeks IM and 4 weeks Hospitalist) ER (5 weeks and
longitudinal sessions) and Family Medicine (13 weeks).

Each rotation begins with a goal setting conversation with your rotation lead
to help define your specialist experience. Each specialist experience is
unique for each learner, guided by your needs and CCFP curriculum
expectations. An example of this is Surgery. If you have plenty of experience
in general surgery for example and little in orthopedics, plastics and
ophthalmology, we encourage you to create a surgery rotation schedule to
reflect those needs. We wish for you to identify your needs and learning gaps,
so we may help you progress them to competence. During the majority of
specialist rotations, you will have a day back in your “home” clinic to
support your longitudinal FM experience.

**PGY2 Overview**

The whole of R2 is dedicated to Family Medicine and can include an optional up
to 4 months Rural FP Rotations and 8 weeks of (optional) elective time. You
also have the opportunity to integrate longitudinal experiences into your FM
week including ER, OB, MSK, Dermatology, Addictions Medicine, Palliative
Medicine and Indigenous Health clinics.

The majority of your two years is spent in the Family Medicine office. In the
last few weeks of residency, Residents may have the opportunity to cover their
FM preceptor office (GP Practicum) for a maximum of 2 weeks.

**Indigenous Health**

We have a meaningful and rich Site Curriculum which includes a local
Indigenous Health education Program followed in late R1 and R2 with Resident
led on-Reserve Clinics on Friday mornings.

**Academic Days**

Academic teaching takes place each Friday afternoon in Comox Valley or
Campbell River. When non-virtual – this means travel for half of our Residents
from one teaching community to the other. The AHD comprises three one-hour
teaching topics, ideally two sessions led by a specialist and one led by
Residents and facilitated by a Family Physician. The Resident session supports
our learners on their teaching journeys and shares learning around clinical
experiences to help prepare for CCFP and independent Practice.

We cover the 99 topics, hot topics, guidelines, McMaster Modules, Behavioral
Medicine and whatever your passion or need may be. We hope to keep these
sessions active and learner-centered.

Each week you will have a dedicated Resident-only meeting led by the Site
Resident Leads prior to AHD to promote wellness through near-peer support.

We have our extremely popular Simulation sessions every 4-6 weeks, with
teaching and hands -on experience around a Simulation curriculum topic.

**Research**

In R1, residents complete a quality improvement project.

In R2 residents complete a scholar project

In May/June of each year, Residents come together for a Site Scholarship Day
and present their scholarly work to our local community

**Electives**

We have up to 8 weeks optional elective time available. All electives are
discussed and agreed with the Site Director at Periodic Review and Primary
Preceptor to help align them with your educational needs and learning gaps.
Although Strathcona is considered a rural site, residents can opt to
participate in the central program rural selective if they wish.

After the CCFP exam in R2, elective time may include ‘transition to practice’
time e.g. intensive OB experience prior to commencing independent practice
that includes OB.



**International Electives**

Residents may take up to one month of Out of Province or international
electives as part of their elective time. This has to meet the standards
required by Central Program.

**Further Training**

Third year training positions are available in the area of Emergency Medicine,
Care of The Elderly, Anesthesia, Palliative Medicine, Sports and Exercise
Medicine, Clinician Scholars program and a wide range of other category 2
Enhanced Skills programs.

# Training Sites

The Strathcona Site is located midway on the eastern coast of Vancouver Island
and is named in honor of the beautiful Strathcona Provincial Park that forms
the backdrop and unites the communities of the Comox Valley and Campbell
River. The culture is rich and diverse with music, art and recreation.

Residents will have the majority of the clinical work in the local communities
and living in the area would be both beneficial and expected. Driving is
essential to commute between communities.
