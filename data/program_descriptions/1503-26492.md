# Important Information

**Temerty Faculty of Medicine’s Commitment to Equity, Diversity and
Inclusion**  
All postgraduate training programs at the Temerty Faculty of Medicine of the
University of Toronto are committed to create, support, and maintain a
learning and working environment that is free from discrimination, harassment,
intimidation, bullying, and disrespectful behaviour. We also strive to recruit
and retain learners, staff and faculty that reflect the diversity of Canadian
society, and assure that our programs and curricula prepare our graduates to
meet the needs of the diverse communities they will serve in their careers in
Canada and around the world. We are committed to working with all
underrepresented/minoritized populations (including 2SLGBTQIA+ people,
Indigenous Peoples of Canada, people of African ancestry and other racialized
groups, people with disabilities, the economically disadvantaged, those from
rural or remote communities, and more) in order to advance all forms of
equity, and in particular, health equity.

  
**CaRMS Self-Identification Questionnaire (CSIQ)  
** The University of Toronto is actively evaluating how and if the CaRMS Self-
Identification Questionnaire (CSIQ) will be used in our application and
selection processes.  We believe it is critical to have a fair, transparent,
and robust process established prior to integrating the CSIQ into our
selection processes.  
  
_For the 2025 R1 Match,  if you assign the CSIQ to any University of Toronto
program, the program will NOT be able to view the content of your CSIQ
response. There are programs that provide applicants other opportunities to
self-identify as a member of an equity-seeking group. Please see individual
program descriptions for details._  

**Electives**  
While elective experiences in our discipline are highly encouraged, as this
helps demonstrate your interest and aptitude in the field, an elective at the
University of Toronto is not required. We recognize that not all candidates
have the opportunity to arrange and complete electives outside of their home
institution and would like to reassure you this will not negatively impact
your application to the University of Toronto.

**Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada**

Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada:  Applying competency-based
practices to residency education

To contribute to the success of Canadian physicians and the delivery of high-
quality patient care, the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada
has embarked upon an initiative to introduce competency-based medical
education (CMBE)  in Canadian postgraduate specialty training and in
professional practice in Canada. This initiative, called Competence by design
(CBD), aims to enhance patient care by aligning medical education and lifelong
learning with evolving patient needs and empowering learners to more fully
engage in their education process.

CBD will use time as a framework rather than the basis for progression.  It is
not anticipated that the duration of training will change for the majority of
trainees.  Residency programs will be broken down into stages, and each stage
will have a series of milestones based on required competencies. These
milestones will create more targeted learning outcomes and involve more
frequent, formative assessments within the clinical workplace to ensure
residents are developing and receiving feedback on the skills they need.

The Royal College anticipates that all specialty and subspecialty programs in
Canada will adopt CBD in gradual phases.  All disciplines have been divided
into seven cohort groups, each of which will adopt CBD at different times.
National implementation of CBD within certain, individual programs has
commenced in July 2017, with more disciplines to follow in subsequent years.

Neurosurgery has implemented these changes as of July of 2019.

All programs implementing CBD will continue to undergo the same rigorous
accreditation processes as traditional programs.  All CBD programs (and
traditional programs) will continue to lead to Royal College approved
certification.  Certification for trainees in both CBD and traditional
programs will include the completion of a Royal College examination; however,
residents in CBD programs will also be assessed against program milestones
throughout their training.  Within a CBD program, all milestones (documented
within an electronic portfolio) and the Royal College examination must be
successfully completed to achieve certification.

For more information, please contact cbd@royalcollege.ca.

# Program Highlights

Didactic Curriculum

The University of Toronto, Division of Neurosurgery, runs an active virtual
didactic curriculum for residents every Friday morning (Brain School). Time to
attend these teaching sessions is protected, with residents relieved of
clinical and on-call duties during this time, to facilitate their attendance.
Lectures are organized by topic and sub-specialty and led by faculty
representatives, and overseen by an educational and curriculum director.  The
curriculum consists of lectures, videos, mock oral examinations, and case
presentations and is a major component of neurosurgical education delivery.
Lecture presentations are stored on a webpage for neurosurgery residents and
is password protected. Residents studying for their written examinations or
preparing for their Royal College Examination will review these lecture notes
on a regular basis.

Quick Facts

The University of Toronto, Division of Neurosurgery has opportunity for
electives for its residents. Three to six month elective may be possible if
scheduling permits and planned in advance. This is usually taken during the
PGY-4 to 5 year level. It can be in a neurosurgical subject or a non-surgical
neuroscience topic. Examples of previous electives taken by residents include
Canadian private practice, academic neurosurgery in other North American or
international centres, and neurosurgical outreach in low income countries.

Currently, there are 32 residents enrolled in the University of Toronto
Neurosurgical Residency Training Program, 35 faculty members with 7 affiliated
neurosurgery scientists.

There are no mandatory rural rotations.



* * *

# Program Curriculum

This residency program is for 6 years.

Program length of training does not exceed the Royal College or College of
Family Physicians of Canada standard.

PGY-1 & 2 Surgical Foundations Objectives of Training

The Division of Neurosurgery is a participant in the Core Surgical Program at
the University of Toronto. The PGY-1 year consists of 4 weeks of Surgery and
Neurosurgery Prep Camp Orientation, 8 blocks of adult neurosurgery (includes
neurotrauma/neurocritical care), 2 blocks of pediatric neurosurgery, 2 blocks
of surgical elective (selected from neurosurgery-spine, orthopedic-spine,
vascular, thoracic, plastics or ENT), and 1 block of emergency medicine.  The
PGY-2 year consists of 2 blocks of neurocritical care, 2 blocks of Neurology,
and 9 blocks of neurosurgery.

Effective July 1, 2008 all University of Toronto PGY1 residents are required
to complete the web based PGCorEd core competency modules as part of their
residency program certification. These modules provide the foundation for the
non-Medical Expert roles for the Royal College of Physician and Surgeons of
Canada Specialty Programs.

These modules will be required for completion before the end of the PGY2 year.
Failure to complete the modules required by their program will delay
processing of their FITERs and may constitute professional misconduct.



PGY-3 to 6  
  

The total amount of clinical neurosurgical experience required by the
University of Toronto program and the Royal College is 42 months. Included in
the 42 months of clinical neurosurgery are 6 blocks on pediatric neurosurgery
and 13 blocks (12 months) as a Chief neurosurgical resident. Neurosurgical
residents rotate through neuropathology for 1 block during PGY5.

Residents are expected to pass the Royal College Foundation of Surgery
Examination in their PGY-2 year.  PGY1 and PGY2 residents attend the
Department of Surgery, Foundation of Surgery Lecture Series on Tuesday
mornings. Throughout the program, residents are expected to develop skills in
microsurgical techniques, spinal neurosurgery, cranial neurosurgery and
peripheral nerve and brachial plexus surgery. Financial support toward
attendance at academic conferences is provided, especially for residents whose
work has been accepted for presentation at the meeting.

  
  

Research and Courses  
  

The description of research training in the Division of Neurosurgery at the

Seminars and Other Formal Teaching Sessions

All residents have an opportunity to attend the Lougheed Microsurgical Course,
and the ATLS Course.

The weekly 3-hour didactic neurosurgical and basic science lecture curriculum
(Friday morning "Brain School") is supplemented with various formal rounds,
journal clubs hosted at faculty residences, seminars, and annual visiting
professorships.

The University of Toronto Surgical Skills Laboratory provides opportunities
for technical training in Core and Specialized Neurosurgery at the PGY-1 level
(see below), including an intensive "Neurosurgery Crash Course" held during
the month of July of the PGY1 year. Numerous practical anatomy and dissection
courses are held throughout the academic year for all residents.



PGY1 Prep Camp

As of July 1, 2013, the Department of Surgery and University of Toronto
Surgical Skill Centre located at Mount Sinai Hospital introduced a new
curriculum format for technical skills training for PGY1 surgical residents.
The new curriculum focuses on a 2-week summer training session incorporating
both technical skill programs and didactic sessions.  All sessions are
relevant to the Royal College CANMEDS design.

The Prep Camp program includes the following:

Each day begins at 0800 hrs with a 1 hr didactic lecture followed by hands on
sessions in the Surgical Lab from 0900-1400 hrs.  Between 1400-1600 hrs, this
time is dedicated to independent practice and research in education
opportunities within the Surgical Lab environs.  Instructors for the summer
sessions include nurses, residents, faculty, industry and associate health
care partners.



PGY1 Neurosurgery Crash Course

Every summer, the Division of Neurosurgery runs an intensive practical
introductory course for our new PGY1s to learn about the acute management of
important neurosurgical conditions.  This is taught by senior residents and
prepares our new residents for the acuity of patients seen in neurosurgery.
