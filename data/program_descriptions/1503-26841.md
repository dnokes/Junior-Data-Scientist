# Selection Criteria

Applicants must submit an application to each site they are interested in and
should assign the same set of documents to each site. Selection is based on
file review and one set of MMI interviews. Each file is reviewed and given a
score. This file review score determines whether a candidate is offered an
interview. The file review score is then combined with the interview score and
FMProC score to create a total score for each applicant. **The file review
score will contribute to 50%, interview score will contribute to 45%, and
FMProC score will contribute to 5% of the overall global score.** This total
score informs the creation of a rank list which is submitted to each site for
consideration. Some sites will use this as the final rank list while some
sites will apply their own adjustments to this list based on local site
selection committee input.

# Program Highlights

### **Uniquely B.C:  UBC Family Medicine**

[Family Medicine training in BC](https://postgrad.familypractice.ubc.ca/)
presents you with many unique opportunities. We are a fully accredited
distributed program with 23 training sites and multiple training communities.
In an effort to meet the evolving needs of our society, each site provides a
solid foundation in the knowledge and clinical skills of Family Medicine so
that our graduates are prepared to practice in a variety of settings. While
our program offers diversity of training, it is based on [common goals,
learning objectives, and assessment
standards](https://postgrad.familymed.ubc.ca/program-info/).

All residents are required to do a [mandatory 2-month rural
rotation](https://postgrad.familymed.ubc.ca/resident-resources/rural-
rotation/) in Family Medicine in their second year. Residents in the Coastal,
or rural programs in the Okanagan or the North complete longer rural
placements. Residents can also apply to participate in Enhanced Rural training
for a total of 4-6 months in rural communities.

There is extensive [academic and administrative
support](https://postgrad.familymed.ubc.ca/about/program-matrix/) for the
entire residency program. Our central program administrative team is based in
Vancouver on UBC campus. At the site level, leadership teams are made up of a
Site Director, Site Faculty, Lead Residents and administrators. Lead Program
Faculty provide provincial education support in the areas of curriculum,
assessment, faculty development, scholarship and behavioral medicine.

The Family Practice Postgraduate Education Committee has representation from
all sites to ensure a connected, distributed program that fully meets
accreditation standards. Residents are represented at all levels of
governance.

A wide range of amazing recreational and cultural opportunities are at your
doorstep, as well as a collegial community of residents and physicians with
whom you can learn, grow, and play. We want your experience to be in BC to be
a positive and enjoyable one.

residents throughout the course of the training.

All UBC programs are allocated a fixed amount of funding per resident for
Resident Activities.  This funding is used to provide educational support to
residents during their 2 years of training. This includes funding for
residents to attend program-wide courses and events. Additionally, residents
may identify conferences and educational materials that would supplement their
training experience. A discretionary, per resident funding will also be
allocated to the sites for a similar purpose at the site level.

* * *

# Program Curriculum

This residency program is for 2 years.

Program length of training does not exceed the Royal College or College of
Family Physicians of Canada standard.

**Introduction**

The Nanaimo Site offers a learner centered curriculum with strong educational
focus. A wide spectrum of family physician and specialist colleagues offer
preceptor based experiential learning in an environment of mutual support and
respect. Each resident is connected with a family practice clinic with
multiple family physician preceptors. Residents achieve their own patient
population and follow patients throughout their 2 year program. The academic
curriculum is accomplished during full academic weeks interspersed throughout
the year. Residents are not in rotations and are not on call for another
discipline during academic weeks. There is elective opportunity in the R2
year. There is learner centred self- scheduling for holidays, call
responsibility and daily schedules.



**Purpose / Objectives**

The Vision of the Nanaimo site is to train Family Physicians to have
knowledge, attitudes and skills to improve health and wellbeing of patients,
care providers and communities. This site will contribute to the research and
application of all CANMed’s FM roles for the learners, faculty, and
communities.

Our Mission is to provide a postgraduate family practice residency program as
a community-based UBC, Affiliated Regional Medical Training Centre, in
collaboration with the UBC Postgraduate Residency Training Program, Island
Medical Program and the Island Health. This site will assist learners, enhance
the professional environment for the faculty and staff, and will improve the
health care of central Vancouver Island citizens.



**Site Objectives**

  * The Nanaimo Site will provide a central Vancouver Island Family Medicine Residency Program that is based on CanMEDS-FM roles, with an integrated rotational approach.
  * The graduating residents will provide their knowledge, attitudes and skills in comprehensive family medicine in rural, regional or urban settings.
  * The learning environment will be focused on family practice problem-solving skills and based on principles of effective adult education.
  * The residents will be part of a community network of health care providers and will become skilled collaborating team members and team leaders.
  * The graduating residents will have expert knowledge of the wide range of common problems of patients in these communities and of the less common but life-threatening and treatable emergencies in patients of all stages of the life cycle.
  * The excellent training will be a cooperative venture between this community-based training site and the resident.
  * Family Medicine will be taught by family physicians whose philosophy and practice are consistent with the aims and aspirations of College of Family Physicians of Canada.



**PGY1 and PGY2 Overview**

in any Canadian community. The curriculum has been created to maximize the
integration of the hospital, the office and the community work of the Family
Physician. The focus in first year is on acute presentations and management.

**Academic Days and Research**

Residents attend mandatory academic week activities. This includes academic
teaching which is a mix of clinical case discussions and core topics.
Residents are also expected to do presentations. Throughout the program, we
stress "Evidence-Based Health Care" in both academic and clinical areas.

In May of each year, residents will come together for a mandatory Site
specific Scholarship Day.

In the first year, residents will be expected to complete a quality
improvement project. Throughout the two years, residents must complete a
scholar project and present their work at Scholarship Day.



**International Electives**

Residents can do one month of interprovincial or international electives
during their training.



**Further Training**

Third year training positions are available in the area of Emergency Medicine,
Care of The Elderly, Anesthesia, Palliative Medicine, Sports and Exercise

Enhanced Skills programs.

# Training Sites

Located on central Vancouver Island, Nanaimo, known as the Harbour City, is
Vancouver Island's second largest city with a population of 100,000. It is a
regional service centre and supports a diversified economy, with tourism being
a major contributor. There are excellent recreational opportunities in the
central Vancouver Island region.

Residents should expect to live in the area as the majority of the clinical
work will occur in that community.



**Resources**

The Nanaimo Site offers a good balance of responsibility and education in a
community that strongly supports the UBC Postgraduate Family Practice
Residency Program. A wide spectrum of family physician and specialist
colleagues eagerly offer preceptor based experiential learning in an
environment of mutual support and respect. Each resident is assigned a
community family practice clinic with multiple family physician preceptors.
Residents achieve their own patient population within their community family
practice clinic and follow those patients throughout their 2 year residency
program.
