# Selection Criteria

Applicants must submit an application to each site they are interested in and
should assign the same set of documents to each site. Selection is based on
file review and one set of MMI interviews. Each file is reviewed and given a
score. This file review score determines whether a candidate is offered an
interview. The file review score is then combined with the interview score and
FMProC score to create a total score for each applicant. **The file review
score will contribute to 50%, interview score will contribute to 45%, and
FMProC score will contribute to 5% of the overall global score.** This total
score informs the creation of a rank list which is submitted to each site for
consideration. Some sites will use this as the final rank list while some
sites will apply their own adjustments to this list based on local site
selection committee input.

# Program Highlights

### **Uniquely B.C:  UBC Family Medicine**

[Family Medicine training in BC](https://postgrad.familypractice.ubc.ca/)
presents you with many unique opportunities. We are a fully accredited
distributed program with 23 training sites and multiple training communities.
In an effort to meet the evolving needs of our society, each site provides a
solid foundation in the knowledge and clinical skills of Family Medicine so
that our graduates are prepared to practice in a variety of settings. While
our program offers diversity of training, it is based on [common goals,
learning objectives, and assessment
standards](https://postgrad.familymed.ubc.ca/program-info/).

All residents are required to do a [mandatory 2-month rural
rotation](https://postgrad.familymed.ubc.ca/resident-resources/rural-
rotation/) in Family Medicine in their second year. Residents in the Coastal,
or rural programs in the Okanagan or the North complete longer rural
placements. Residents can also apply to participate in Enhanced Rural training
for a total of 4-6 months in rural communities.

There is extensive [academic and administrative
support](https://postgrad.familymed.ubc.ca/about/program-matrix/) for the
entire residency program. Our central program administrative team is based in
Vancouver on UBC campus. At the site level, leadership teams are made up of a
Site Director, Site Faculty, Lead Residents and administrators. Lead Program
Faculty provide provincial education support in the areas of curriculum,
assessment, faculty development, scholarship and behavioral medicine.

The Family Practice Postgraduate Education Committee has representation from
all sites to ensure a connected, distributed program that fully meets
accreditation standards. Residents are represented at all levels of
governance.

A wide range of amazing recreational and cultural opportunities are at your
doorstep, as well as a collegial community of residents and physicians with

All UBC programs are allocated a fixed amount of funding per resident for
Resident Activities.  This funding is used to provide educational support to
residents during their 2 years of training. This includes funding for
residents to attend program-wide courses and events. Additionally, residents
may identify conferences and educational materials that would supplement their
training experience. A discretionary, per resident funding will also be
allocated to the sites for a similar purpose at the site level.

# Program Curriculum

This residency program is for 2 years.

Program length of training does not exceed the Royal College or College of
Family Physicians of Canada standard.

**Introduction**

Welcome to UBC Prince George site! This training program is designed to
prepare you for northern focused full-service family medicine, with influences
from rural generalism, giving you the opportunity to explore both semi-urban
and rural practice. You will experience a breadth of medicine and surgery
applicable to full service practice and participate in regular call of varying
intensity. These two short years are not designed to be exhaustive but have
been shaped to achieve competency and confidence.



Prince George is block based for both R1 and R2, with selectives in several
rotations allowing for added flexibility and customization. Our program is
uniquely positioned in the North, providing block-based rotations at a
regional referral hospital (with a generous compliment of specialists) while
still offering authentic rural experiences. Depending on availability from
year to year, you can choose to complete blocks of many core rotations
(Surgery, Obstetrics, Emergency Medicine, Etc.) either in Prince George or at
peripheral sites.



**Consider our site if you:**

  * Enjoy the outdoors in all four seasons
  * Are interested in authentic family medicine training which will prepare you for a variety of practice types
  * See full-service family practice or locums in your future
  * Want the ability to transition directly into northern practice.



**Please do not consider our site if you:**

  * Are looking for no-call
  * Do not wish to live in the North for at least the duration of residency
  * Are interested in urban based “referral style” medicine



We have a co-site director model shared between James Card and Bron
Finkelstein, both rural family physicians who trained through the Prince
George site. Autonomy, self-efficacy and professionalism are key tenets of our
site, with the pursuit of individual interests strongly encouraged.



If you would like more information on any of our programs, please contact us

# Training Sites

**Location**

Prince George is a city of 80,000 serving the majority of Northern BC. The
referral area is approximately 250,000. It is located in the geographic centre
of British Columbia, approximately 800 km from Vancouver, Edmonton, Calgary
and Kelowna. The population is young and the economic base is in forestry and
servicing the northern region.

Lakes and rivers abound with excellent summer opportunities to kayak, hike,
canoe, fish or just swim. There is an extensive network of trails within the
city for running and mountain biking. Winter activities include a range from
cross country skiing (classic or skate), hockey and speed skating. The
surrounding area affords easy access to the mountains for camping, backpacking
and downhill or backcountry skiing. Prince George is home to the Cougars (a
Junior A hockey team), a symphony orchestra and an excellent semi-professional
theater.  We are fortunate to have the beautiful University of Northern BC
campus located in Prince George. The UNBC Medical School opened its doors in
2004 and graduated its first class in 2008. Current alumni include many of the
local family and specialist Physicians including the program’s site director!

Prince George is an area where housing is affordable, the commute is short,
and there are endless recreational opportunities at your doorstep. It provides
a great opportunity for optimal work-life balance. For those with connections
to the city, there are multiple daily flights to Vancouver on WestJet, Air
Canada, and others.

The primary focus of our program is the training of family physicians for work
in communities outside major metropolitan areas with an emphasis on preparing
the resident for primary care and management of acutely ill or injured
patients, especially when access to a specialist's care may be limited. Our
setting affords the resident the opportunity to learn procedural skills and
assume responsibility for a variety of clinical problems.

Small town practice frequently requires a family physician to take charge of
evolving acute clinical problems. Much of this happens after hours. The
importance of on-call time is recognized and supported. Call is busy, occurs
approximately 1:4. Friday is a common night off, when we encourage residents
to gather socially.

Prospective applicants are invited to visit our website at Department of
Family Practice for more information and to be in touch with current
residents,

Undergraduate students wishing to do a clerkship elective with us are invited
to apply for a limited number of positions through the Undergraduate Dean's
website: Clerkship Electives Program.



**Resources**

The University Hospital of Northern BC is a tertiary care hospital and is the
major referral center for Northern BC. A Cancer Clinic which offers medical
and radiation treatment opened in 2012. A Learning Center was opened in spring
of 2015 which expanded our teaching and meeting facilities significantly and
provided a new and improved location for our SIM lab.

The 201 acute beds include 10 ICU/CCU beds, 8 NICU beds and a dedicated
clinical teaching unit for Internal Medicine and Pediatrics.  The Emergency
department treats 46,000 patients annually making it one of the busiest
emergency departments in the province. The department is the only dedicated
trauma center for the North with 2 dedicated trauma bays, 16 acute care beds
and a minor treatment unit. Family Physicians remain highly involved with both
inpatient and emergency care.

9 general surgeons and 7 orthopedic specialists perform 2500 surgical
procedures annually. There is a busy ambulatory outpatient department with an
endoscopy suite and rooms for outpatient minor surgery.

A majority of the 1040 deliveries annually are managed by Family Physicians
and midwives. This active unit is capable of managing high risk or complicated
deliveries with obstetricians and pediatricians providing consultant care.

Family Practice teaching has been centered in a purpose built, free standing
clinic within a two-minute walk to the hospital. The clinic houses the
majority of our Family Physician preceptors, serving 16,000 patients. In 2014,
we expanded to include community offices with additional preceptors. All
practices use the same electronic medical record and are connected to the
hospital systems allowing for access to all laboratory and radiology results.
All practices embrace leading edge practice solutions such as group visits,
multidisciplinary care from a primary care home and integrated health
strategies, ever encouraged by the Prince George Division of Family Practice.

Our Purpose is to foster diversity and clinical excellence to produce
competent, professional, full service family physicians. Our Aspiration is to
be a connected, vibrant community of adaptable family physicians and trainees,
committed to an excellent learning environment, high quality primary care and
community health and well-being.
