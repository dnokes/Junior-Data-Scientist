## Welcome from Swift Current Site Director

Welcome to the community of Swift Current, Saskatchewan. The motto, "where

Lastly, we have great festivals in the spring including our unique Windscape

program is proud to train generalist family physicians capable of broad scope
practice at the completion of their training. We hope to see you soon!

## **Welcome from the Program Director**

Welcome to the University of Saskatchewan Family Medicine Program! My name is
Sheila Smith and I will be your program director. We want to support you to do
your best work. Our program provides opportunities to practice inclusive and
equitable care to our patients and our communities. You will experience
learning environments that are strengthened by our diverse and inclusive
teams. Our program is constantly learning and innovating and we welcome you to

**Important Information for Applicants**

schools. Applicants are responsible for reviewing the [University of
Saskatchewan Policies for the R1 Match](https://www.carms.ca/match/r-1-main-
residency-match/eligibility-criteria/saskatchewan/) to determine if they meet
all requirements and eligibility criteria. Failure to meet or provide proof of
any of the stated requirements or documents may result in an applicant’s file
not being reviewed or ranked.

applicants who are graduating in the spring will need to provide a copy of
their medical degree/diploma to the PGME office and the College of Physicians

**Applicants completing medical education at the University of Montreal,
Sherbrooke, Laval, and the University of Ottawa (French stream)**  are

deadline to demonstrate they meet CPSS requirements. More information is
available under Supporting Documentation-Language Proficiency.

**NOTE:**  Applicants who are considering a delay to their convocation date
must be aware that a medical degree cannot be issued to a student until they
have convocated. CPSS bylaws require that new residents must have received
their medical degree prior to the commencement of residency training. Choosing
to delay convocation will affect a matched applicant’s ability to commence
their residency training program in Saskatchewan on July 1. Please refer to
the [U of S CaRMS Deferral Policy](https://medicine.usask.ca/policies/carms-

Any delays in providing all required documentation to the Saskatchewan Health
Authority may result in a delay in the start of postgraduate training beyond
July 1st.

**Resident Boot Camp  
** All matched applicants must attend a mandatory three-day Resident Boot Camp
scheduled for late June. The purpose of the Boot Camp is to provide additional
support to trainees as they transition to residency by introducing and

practice sessions. Stipends will be provided to trainees.

Attendance is required and absences are only permitted in exceptional
circumstances, with prior approval of PGME.

** Matched applicants are required to provide proof of ACLS certification
(current as of July 1, 2025) to the PGME office prior to starting their
