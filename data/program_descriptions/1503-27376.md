# Program Curriculum

This residency program is for 5 years.

Program length of training does not exceed the Royal College or College of
Family Physicians of Canada standard.

PROGRAM:**GENERAL DESCRIPTION:**

The Psychiatry Residency Program is a comprehensive five-year training program
designed to prepare physicians for certification by the Royal College of
Physicians and Surgeons of Canada in both clinical and academic psychiatry.
The program begins with the PGY-1 year, a foundational clinical training
period aimed at consolidating medical school knowledge and skills.

During the junior years (PGY-2 and PGY-3) and senior years (PGY-4 and PGY-5),
residents work under the supervision of attending psychiatrists, gaining
experience across a diverse patient population. The curriculum includes
training in general Adult Psychiatry, Child Psychiatry, Geriatric Psychiatry,
Consultation Liaison Psychiatry, Psychotherapy, Collaborative Care, Concurrent
Disorders, Dual Diagnosis, and the management of severe and persistent mental
illnesses. Opportunities for subspecialty training are available in Forensic
Psychiatry, Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and Geriatric Psychiatry.
Additionally, an Area of Focused Competence (AFC) in Addictions can be pursued
during the senior years.

Senior residents have extensive elective opportunities, including Community
Psychiatry, Sleep Disorders, Research, Addictions, Eye Movement
Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT),
Neuropsychiatry, Gender Clinic, Physician Health, and Clinical Ethics, among
others. The program emphasizes flexibility in electives, allowing residents to
explore their specific interests. Research opportunities are detailed in other
sections of the program.

The educational experience evolves from closely supervised work in the initial
years to more independent, self-directed learning by the end of the fourth and
fifth years. Resident research expectations align with Royal College
guidelines, and academic activities include participation in Resident Journal
Club, Grand Rounds, and a Scholarly Project with a mentor. Practice Objective
Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) examinations are held biannually for
PGY-2 to PGY-5 residents, with senior residents also serving as examiners. The
annual Coordinators of Psychiatric Education (COPE) exam provides a multiple-
choice self-assessment opportunity.

Wednesday afternoons are reserved for the Academic Half-Day (AHD), which runs
throughout the year and includes a focus on Transcultural Psychiatry,
reflected in seminars and a dedicated Transcultural Day. PGY-4 residents
benefit from interview skills seminars, while PGY-1 and PGY-2 residents
participate in a summer seminar series covering various topics, including the
assessment and management of aggressive patients, Electroconvulsive Therapy
(ECT) workshops, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), treatment guidelines, and
the Alberta Mental Health Act. Popular events include field trips, facility
tours, and a Land-Based Indigenous Healing session.

Journal Club and Grand Rounds are key components of the program. Residents
present twice at Journal Club and twice at Grand Rounds, which feature a mix
of international, national, and local speakers, including resident
presentations.

Residents are actively involved in program governance through monthly Resident
Business Meetings, where updates from the Residency Program Committee (RPC)
are shared. They hold positions on various committees, such as Well-being,
Cross-Cultural, and Health Advocacy Committees, and participate in the
program's social activities. A formal mentorship program supports newcomers,
and funding is available for conference attendance. Residents may also pursue
away electives in line with Royal College and program guidelines.

In addition to clinical training, residents have opportunities to teach
University of Alberta medical students in small group seminars and other
formal teaching settings, such as pre-clerkship small groups and case-based
learning. The program values and supports resident teaching development.

The Psychiatry Residency Program is a comprehensive five-year training program
accredited by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (RCPSC).
Our program has fully adopted Competence by Design (CBD), a transformative
medical education initiative introduced by the RCPSC. Unlike traditional time-
based training, CBD uses time as a flexible resource, ensuring that residents
progress based on their development of targeted competencies by attaining
measurable competencies through completing Entrustable Professional Activities
(EPAs).

Residency is composed of four stages:

**Transition to Discipline (TD) Stage of Training (First 3 Blocks of PGY-1 = 3
Blocks)**

The first three training blocks serve as an essential introduction to the
Psychiatry Residency Program and the Edmonton healthcare system. This initial
stage offers residents a smooth transition into their new roles, with a
structured orientation process that blends foundational knowledge with
practical clinical experience.

  * Interactive Orientation:** **

The stage offers an interactive academic curriculum, where new residents
receive foundational knowledge in psychiatry, engage in team-building
activities, and have the opportunity to meet faculty members and fellow
residents. This helps residents understand their roles and expectations while
fostering a sense of community.

Residents rotate through three psychiatry blocks, including:

Community and rural psychiatry (1 Block)

Child and adolescent psychiatry (2 weeks) + Forensic psychiatry (2 weeks) (1
Block)

Emergency psychiatry (1 Block)

These rotations are designed to provide initial exposure to the field and
allow residents to practice fundamental skills such as psychiatric
interviewing, patient assessment, and case presentation. Residents begin
applying their newly acquired knowledge in real-world situations by working
closely with supervisors.

**Foundations of Discipline (FD) Stage of Training (PGY-1 to Block 12 of
PGY-2, = 22 Blocks)**

The FD stage spans the remainder of PGY-1 through Block 12 of PGY-2 and
focuses on building core competencies in psychiatry. This stage emphasizes
developing the foundational skills needed for psychiatric assessment,
treatment, and management while reinforcing the integration of physical
medicine with psychiatric care. Residents rotate through various settings,
gaining a comprehensive understanding of common and complex psychiatric
conditions.

  * Integration of Physical and Psychiatric Medicine (PGY-1):

A key focus of the FD stage is reinforcing the connection between physical and
psychiatric health. This rest year of PGY-1 emphasizes the interface between
physical medicine and psychiatry, ensuring that residents can investigate and
manage medical conditions commonly encountered in psychiatric settings,
including addiction disorders. The program also emphasizes the management of
the physical comorbidities frequently accompanying psychiatric conditions.
Residents are trained to handle these complex cases through rotations that
include:

General internal medicine (2 Blocks)

Emergency medicine (1 Block)

Family medicine (1 Block)

Inpatient neurology (1 Block)

Outpatient neurology & brain Injury (1 Block)

Vacation (1 Block)

Selective and elective rotation (1 Block)

Geriatric medicine (1 Block)

Addiction medicine (1 Block)

  * Core Clinical Psychiatry Rotations (PGY-2): 

In PGY-2, residents build upon their core psychiatric skills by conducting
comprehensive interviews to gather detailed patient histories and performing
mental status examinations to assess cognitive, emotional, and behavioural
functioning. They also work on forming accurate diagnoses while creating
biopsychosocial formulations to develop individualized treatment plans that
integrate psychopharmacology and therapeutic interventions.

Additionally, residents become proficient in evaluating and managing risks
such as suicide, aggression, and self-harm, ensuring comprehensive care for a
wide range of psychiatric conditions. During this year, they receive formal
training in psychopharmacology, psychotherapy, and neurostimulation, with
opportunities to lead and participate in group therapies, further enhancing
their clinical expertise and leadership skills.

Inpatient Psychiatry Rotation (6 Blocks)

Residents manage acute psychiatric conditions in hospitalized patients,
focusing on stabilization, diagnosis, and treatment planning. This rotation
exposes residents to severe mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, bipolar
disorder, and major depression, where they work in multidisciplinary teams.
Through this experience, they gain hands-on practice in conducting psychiatric
assessments, evaluating risks, and developing comprehensive treatment plans
that combine medication management and therapeutic interventions.

Outpatient Psychiatry Rotation (6 Blocks)

Residents manage long-term psychiatric conditions, such as anxiety,
depression, and mood disorders, in a less acute setting. This rotation
emphasizes continuity of care, follow-up, and building strong therapeutic
relationships. Residents learn to adjust medication regimens, apply
psychotherapeutic techniques, and manage chronic psychiatric conditions over
time, enhancing their ability to provide well-rounded, sustained care.
Residents also receive formal group therapy during their outpatient rotations.
This training offers residents the skills to facilitate and lead therapeutic
groups, enabling them to address various psychiatric conditions through
collaborative and interpersonal therapeutic settings.

  * Longitional Training:

Residents begin formal psychotherapy training. This includes introducing
different therapeutic modalities such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT),
psychodynamic therapy, and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT). Residents
complete 32 hours of CBT with patients in the FD stage.

Residents will receive Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) training in PGY-2 and
have hands-on experience in managing patients undergoing ECT for severe
psychiatric conditions, including depression, bipolar disorder, and
schizophrenia. Residents are required to complete 60 ECT treatments in the FD
stage.

**Core of Discipline (CD) Stage of Training (Block 13, PGY-2 to End of PGY-4,
= 27 Blocks)**

The Core of Discipline (CD) stage is the heart of psychiatric training,
primarily occurring during PGY-3 and PGY-4 in the CBD framework. This stage
builds on the foundational knowledge and skills acquired in earlier stages (TD
and FD), allowing residents to deepen their expertise in psychiatry and refine
their clinical abilities. The focus of this stage is on the management of
complex psychiatric conditions across a range of subspecialties and lifespans,
advanced psychotherapeutic techniques, and integration of psychopharmacology,
psychotherapy, and neurostimulation treatments.

  * Advanced Clinical Exposure:

Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (6 blocks):

Residents gain expertise in diagnosing and managing psychiatric disorders in
children and adolescents, such as ADHD, autism spectrum disorders, anxiety,
depression, and eating disorders. This rotation includes working closely with
schools, families, and multidisciplinary teams.

Geriatric Psychiatry (6 blocks):

Residents treat older adults with psychiatric conditions, focusing on issues
related to aging, dementia, mood disorders, and psychosis. Understanding the
unique physiological and psychological needs of elderly patients is critical
in this rotation.

Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry (4 Blocks):

This rotation emphasizes the role of psychiatry in the general medical
setting. Residents provide psychiatric care to patients with medical
comorbidities and learn to manage psychiatric symptoms in the context of
physical illness.

Rehabilitation Psychiatry (5 Blocks):

Residents manage patients with severe, persistent mental illnesses in forensic
or non-forensic settings. These patients require long-term psychiatric care,
often those with treatment-resistant disorders such as schizophrenia or
chronic mood disorders. The focus is on rehabilitation, long-term management,
and reintegration into society, addressing complex psychiatric and functional
impairments in a multidisciplinary team setting.

Addiction Psychiatry (1 blocks):

Residents manage substance use disorders such as alcohol dependence and opioid
use disorder. The rotation includes detoxification, medication-assisted
treatments, and relapse prevention strategies, focusing on co-occurring
psychiatric conditions.

Shared-Care Psychiatry (1 blocks):

Residents collaborate with primary care or other specialties (neurology,
dermatology, etc.) teams to manage mental health conditions, integrating
psychiatric expertise with medical care for conditions like anxiety,
depression, neurodevelopmental disorders, and chronic medical-psychiatric
comorbidities.

Electives in PGY-4 (4 Blocks)

The University of Alberta provides diverse opportunities for residents to
develop their career interests and professional goals further. Residents can
choose elective rotations to deepen their expertise in specialized areas of
psychiatry, gain experience in innovative treatments, or pursue academic and
research opportunities (See TTP stage for details).

**Transition to Practice (TTP) Stage of Training (PGY-5 = 13 blocks)**

The Transition to Practice (TTP) stage in PGY-5 marks the final phase of
psychiatric residency training, where residents consolidate their knowledge,
refine skills, and assume increasing clinical responsibility with minimal
supervision. The goal is to prepare residents for independent clinical care,
research, or academic practice.

Residents function with near-complete autonomy, managing complex cases,
conducting assessments, making diagnostic decisions, formulating treatment
plans, and adjusting interventions independently. They also take on leadership
roles, mentoring junior residents and medical students, leading case
conferences, and contributing to clinical decision-making. This stage helps
residents refine supervisory and teaching skills essential for academic and
leadership roles.

Electives during this stage allow residents to specialize in areas such as
Interventional Psychiatry (ECT, rTMS, ketamine therapy), Forensic Psychiatry
(forensic assessments, competency evaluations), Addiction Psychiatry, Child
and Adolescent Psychiatry, Geriatric Psychiatry, Community and Rural
Psychiatry, Psychotherapy Specialization (CBT, DBT, Psychodynamic Therapy),
and Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry (psychiatric care in general hospitals).

Other elective options include Academic Psychiatry and Research, Leadership
and Administrative Psychiatry, Neuropsychiatry, Military and Veteran
Psychiatry, LGBTQ+ Mental Health, Sleep Psychiatry, Eating Disorders
Psychiatry, Women’s Mental Health, and Trauma Psychiatry.

Residents may also explore specialized electives like Clinical Ethics in
Psychiatry, Early Psychosis Clinics, Eye Movement Desensitization and
Reprocessing (EMDR), Multimodal Motion-Assisted Memory Desensitization and
Reconsolidation (3MDR), Psychedelic-Assisted Psychotherapy, Global Mental
Health, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Neurodevelopmental Psychiatry,
Telepsychiatry, and Cultural Psychiatry.

These electives, whether in Edmonton, out-of-province, or globally, provide
flexibility and a tailored learning experience, allowing residents to gain
advanced knowledge and prepare for their chosen career path.

**RESIDENT COMMITTEE REPRESENTATION**

At the Annual Resident Retreat, resident volunteer for various committees for
the upcoming academic year.  Here are some brief descriptions:

Lead Residents  

During each academic year there are two Lead Residents in the Psychiatry
Residency Program who divide the duties of this position. The incoming Junior
Lead is elected from the PGY3 cohort at the Annual Resident Retreat, and the
previous Junior Lead Resident becomes the Senior Lead resident. Lead residents
serve an essential role in the residency program as they provide the
residents’ perspective in matters that involve the residency program. As well,
Lead Residents organize the adult psychiatry resident call schedule. Lead
residents gain valuable experience in leadership.

Class Representatives

Each class of residents from PGY-1 to PGY-5 will select a representative for
the upcoming year, who will provide a voice for their cohort at the Residency
Program Committee.  These representatives will attend the monthly Residency
Program Committee meetings and provide the perspective of their peers to the
Committee and the Program.

Retreat Coordinator

Each year the resident body holds a one-day retreat. This retreat is an
opportunity for the resident body to come together and discuss various
important issues such as rotation and preceptor evaluations, program concerns
and resident well-being concerns. The retreat is also an opportunity for
residents to appoint or elect various committee representatives, and to
nominate, elect or appoint a Lead Resident from the PGY-3 class.

COPE Representative

COPE (Coordinators of Psychiatric Education) is an organization of Canadian
psychiatry residency programs. Each program is represented at annual meetings
by the Program Director and a resident representative. The COPE Representative
serves a two-year term and communicates to the residency program following
each COPE meeting (typically twice per year).

Other Subcommittees

There are multiple subcommittees and working groups of the Residency Program
Committee which allow for resident involvement in the design, planning and
evolution of the residency training program. Led by program leaders, these
subcommittees provide opportunities for residents to lend their perspectives
to decisions involving their learning needs. Other subcommittees which also
require resident members include:

  * Academic Half-Day Working Group
  * On-call Working Group
  * Grand Rounds and Journal Club Working Group
  * Safety Subcommittee
  * Curriculum Subcommittee
  * Learning Environment Subcommittee
  * Resident Research Committee



**Research**

The Department of Psychiatry at the University of Alberta aims to encourage,
enhance and evaluate scholarly activity and research within the residency
program.  As scholars, all doctors should demonstrate a lifelong commitment to
reflective learning, as well as the creation, dissemination, application and
translation of medical knowledge. Research activities in the department range
from laboratory-based biomarkers to clinical research, conducted by a diverse
group of outstanding scientists who are internationally recognized in their
fields. These include neuropsychiatry, mood and anxiety disorders,
schizophrenia, addiction, neuromodulation, and psychotherapy. World-class
investigations are being conducted in these areas, using approaches including
neurochemistry, neuropharmacology, clinical psychopharmacology,
pharmacogenomics, psychiatric genetics, health economics, epidemiology, and
health outcome measurement. Research Groups and Units within the department
include the Translational Psychiatry Research Group, the Bebensee
Schizophrenia Research Unit, the Brain Neurobiology Research Unit, Depression
and Stress Disorders, the Neurochemical Research Unit, and the Psychotherapy
Research Group.

Scholarly activities include presenting at Adult Psychiatry Grand Rounds, and
participation in Journal Club presentations and discussions. Residents have
opportunities to develop the Scholar role and attain EPAs through Journal Club
and Grand Rounds presentations.  

Significant support is available for residents wishing to pursue a research
track. Research elective time is available for residents as well as the
opportunity to do an MSc in Psychiatry during residency. Residents select
research elective(s) in discussion with appropriate supervisor(s), either
joining work in progress or generating their own proposals for original work.
Postgraduate course work can be completed within the department as the
seminars are clustered into formal postgraduate courses. Academic Half Day
seminars can be credited as course work for the Masters program.

Residents prepare a research dossier with the help of the Director of the
Resident Research Committee.
