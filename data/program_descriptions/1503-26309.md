Our selection committee evaluates all complete applications to our program.
Incomplete applications will not be considered. The selection committee is
comprised of the Program Director, members of the Residency Program Committee,
Academic and Community faculty members, Senior Residents as well as the
Program Administrator.

The Program Director evaluates all applicants by each application component:
academic achievement, leadership, quality of reference letters and research
productivity.  Each of the other selection committee members is given a
specific component to score for each applicant.  An average score is
calculated for each of the criteria listed. These scores are then further
combined to generate an overall application score which eventually then
becomes an overall rank. The interview list is based on this rank.

Medical student rotation evaluations and feedback are also collected and
submitted to the selection committee for review during the CaRMS application
shortlist process. These evaluations are scored on knowledge, professionalism,
technical skills, and communication. While these scores are not part of the
official CaRMS scoring rubric, the feedback is discussed amongst the selection
committee and taken into consideration for each candidate and in the overall
rank.

An interview score is generated at the time of the panel style interview by
each of the interviewers and is averaged.  These two scores are then combined
and a final overall rank order is created.

A "do not rank' status may be invoked by consensus, based upon information
attained from the application, the reference letters or what was deemed
inappropriate conduct or responses during the interview process.

# Program Highlights

Our program is the provincial Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery training
program for British Columbia, offering unique opportunities due to our
affiliations with major teaching hospitals in Vancouver, including tertiary
and quaternary centers, a level 1 trauma center, and a dedicated pediatric
hospital. With one of the highest population-to-resident and faculty-to-
resident ratios in the country, we ensure a high volume of clinical and
surgical experiences. We have faculty representation in all Otolaryngology-
Head and Neck Surgery subspecialties with many faculty being leaders in their
respective fields. Recent graduates have completed advanced research degrees
(e.g., MSc, MPH, MEd) at numerous institutions and have secured competitive
fellowships for subspecialty training. The program boasts excellent job
placement in both community and academic settings throughout British Columbia
and beyond. Numerous community rotation options are available in Surrey
(Fraser Valley), Kelowna (Interior BC), and Victoria (Vancouver Island), as
well as opportunities for rural and outreach rotations to underserved
communities. We foster a culture of wellness, creating a supportive community
that thrives on engagement and balance. Our residency program features a
variety of social activities, including an annual bike race, resident retreat,
sports day, research nights, graduation celebration, and many spontaneous get-
togethers, all set against the stunning backdrop of Vancouver

# Program Curriculum

This residency program is for 5 years.

Program length of training does not exceed the Royal College or College of
Family Physicians of Canada standard.

**Introduction**

The UBC Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery residency training program follows
the Competency-Based Medical Education (CBME) model set by the Royal College
of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. Although CBME is no longer strictly
time-based, most residents are expected to complete the program within a five-
year period. The curriculum is organized into PGY 1-2 and PGY 3-5 years, while
the completion of Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs) and milestones is
based on competency rather than a fixed timeline.

### **PGY 1 & 2**

During the first two years of residency, residents will divide their time
approximately equally between general Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery and
complementary disciplines to build a comprehensive foundation for surgical
training. Rotations include General Surgery, Plastic Surgery, Neurosurgery,
Trauma Surgery, Intensive Care, Anesthesia, Adult Emergency Medicine,
Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Internal Medicine, and Surgical Dermatology.

Residents will also participate in a series of core surgery seminars, designed
to prepare them for the Surgical Foundations Examination, which is common
across surgical specialties. Additionally, a one-month 'Crash Program' for all
surgical residents reviews competencies in resuscitation and stabilization of
hospital patients.

##  



### **PGY-3 to 5**

During the third through fifth years, residents engage in preceptor-based
rotations across Otolaryngology - Head & Neck Surgery subspecialty areas,
including Head & Neck Surgical Oncology and Reconstruction, Otology and Neuro-
otology, Rhinology and Skull-Base Surgery, Laryngology, Pediatric
Otolaryngology, and Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery.

The senior years offer flexibility to tailor rotations based on resident
interests and career goals. Opportunities include community settings, rural
and outreach work, and research blocks with faculty mentorship. Residents may
also pursue away electives to explore career opportunities or fellowships at
other centers.

### **Research**

Trainees in the UBC Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery residency program are
expected to engage in research throughout their training. Opportunities are
available in both basic science and a wide range of clinical research areas,
supported by enthusiastic faculty members. We encourage residents to undertake
multi-year projects of substantial scope. Residents are also urged to submit
their research to national and international conferences, with financial
support provided for travel if their work is accepted for presentation.

##  

### **UBC Academic Program**

The UBC Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery residency program includes a
protected academic half-day each week throughout the training period. These
academic sessions are structured around subspecialties and are rotated on a
two-year cycle.

Educational activities encompass divisional Grand Rounds in Otolaryngology-
Head and Neck Surgery, as well as Department of Surgery Grand Rounds. Weekly
multidisciplinary tumor boards at the BC Cancer Agency focus on subsite: head
and neck, thyroid, and skin. Faculty also conduct separate subspecialty based
rounds in Head & Neck Surgery (Surgical Tumour Board), Rhinology (Evening
Rounds), Otology (Morning Rounds), and Laryngology (Lunch Rounds) to discuss
interesting cases.

Journal clubs are integrated into the academic half-day program, providing a
platform to review and discuss practice-changing or challenging literature.
Additionally, a Women in Surgery Journal Club is organized numerous times
throughout the year.

Residents have access to a dedicated temporal bone lab with cadaveric bones,
supervised by Otology faculty. An annual cadaver lab is organized for teaching
sinus surgery by our Rhinologists, and flap harvest techniques by our Head and
Neck Surgeons.



### **Educational Opportunities Abroad**

Financial support for UBC Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery residents may
vary each year, depending on available funds and resident interests.
Typically, the program covers travel expenses for key educational events,
including the Western University Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery Bootcamp
for PGY-1s, the Toronto Temporal Bone Drilling Course for PGY-3s, the
Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery Review Course for PGY-4s, and the American
Academy of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery Annual Meeting for PGY-5s.

In addition, some residents have received support to attend specialized
courses such as the Winnipeg Sinus Course, the AO Facial Trauma Course, and
the FACS Thyroid and Parathyroid Ultrasound Course. Residents are also funded
to attend national and international conferences where their research is
accepted for podium presentation, providing further opportunities for
professional development and learning.

* * *

# Training Sites

The residency program is primarily based at major teaching hospitals in
Vancouver. Call requirements adhere to the Resident Doctors of British
Columbia Collective Bargaining Agreement. Residents cover call at Vancouver
General Hospital, St. Paul’s Hospital, and BC Children’s Hospital.
Responsibilities increase with experience, with junior residents participating
in “buddy call” alongside senior residents. Residents also complete community
hospital rotations in Surrey, Victoria, and Kelowna throughout their training.
There are opportunities for rural and outreach rotations as well as away
electives at other institutions, providing a broad range of clinical
experiences in different settings.

* * *

# Additional Information

**Valid Driver's license** \- A valid driver's license is required due to the
expectation of covering on-call duties at multiple locations and, at times,
the need to reach the hospital quickly.
