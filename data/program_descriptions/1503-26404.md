# Selection Criteria

McMaster University's Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Neurosciences
welcomes eligible individuals to submit CaRMS applications for consideration
of a postgraduate residency position. The following selection criteria are
considered in reviewing applicants' files, selecting candidates for interview,
and for ranking purposes:

  * Evidence of interest in psychiatry
  * Evidence of strong work ethic
  * Evidence of successful team working skills, as well as leadership experiences
  * Strong evidence of professionalism and communication skills
  * Evidence with experiences working within the area of psychiatry including ability to articulate & demonstrate knowledge about the practice of psychiatry
  * Academic record 
  * Evidence of commitment to academic inquiry and scholarly work
  * Strength of letters of reference regarding qualities that will translate to a successful psychiatry residency experience
  * Demonstration of an understanding about the unique educational opportunities offered at McMaster University and how this will benefit their training in psychiatry.
  * Experience with research and other scholarly activity is preferred, although not required.

We recognize that the CoVID-19 pandemic and associated capacity constraints
have impacted candidates' opportuities to arrange and complete electives and
would like to reassure you that the lack of visiting elective opportunties at
McMaster University will not negatively impact your application to our
program.

Candidates who do not provide the required documentation or who submit their
CaRMS application past the CaRMS due date will NOT be considered for an
interview.

All information derived throughout the CaRMS experience is considered relevant
to an applicant's profile, including observations of behavior, including
interaction with Faculty, staff and other applicants, as well as overall
professionalism.

The application and selection process for the McMaster General Psychiatry
Residency Program is designed to be fair and transparent.  A large pool of
applicants is screened by file reviewers with the goal of selecting a cohort
to be invited for an interview. Candidates and the interview panels will be
paired at random, with issues of conflict of interest identified and managed
(e.g., if a faculty member has provided a reference letter for a candidate).
Following the interview component, a committee - comprised of Program
Leadership, and faculty and resident file reviewers and interviewers - reviews
each candidate (based on file review score, interview performance, and other
professional attributes) before compiling a rank order list. Faculty members
with conflicts of interest (e.g., having mentored an applicant, or written a
reference letter for the program) abstain from committee discussions with
regard to the applicant in question.  To ensure accuracy, the Program Director
and Associate Program Director personally review the final rank order list
prior to submission to CaRMS. Concerning unprofessional behaviour, even if all
other components of the application are scored favourably, may be grounds to
not rank a candidate on the final rank order list submitted to CaRMS.

# Program Curriculum

This residency program is for 5 years.

Program length of training does not exceed the Royal College or College of
Family Physicians of Canada standard.

The McMaster General Psychiatry Residency Program is a highly flexible,
responsive and creative training opportunity that encourages and supports
scholarly inquiry, personal initiative, principles of adult learning, and
self-directed learning.

**Curriculum:**

Residency Curriculum:

The residency program emphasizes psychiatry as a medical discipline focused on
the treatment of individuals with serious mental illnesses throughout  the
lifespan. The formal academic curriculum includes a systematic overview of
psychiatric illnesses, neuropsychiatry, evidence-based psychotherapies and
psychopharmacology, principles of critical appraisal, global mental health,
Indigenous mental health, mental health of vulnerable populations, alternate
means of delivering treatment and bringing a lens of equity, diversity &
inclusion to all areas of academic & clinical learning. Core academic seminars
are designed to be highly interactive in nature and take place during
protected academic days throughout the PGY1 to PGY5 years.

Clinical training involves completion of core rotations as mandated by the
Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada and incorporates the
principles and requirements of Competency Based Medical Education.

The first two blocks form the Transition to Discipline Stage of Training,
orienting residents to our program, the university, and the local health care
system while providing a review and assessment of the basic knowledge and
skills required to begin residency training in Psychiatry.  The Transition to
Discipline curriculum also provides creative opportunities for team-building
and networking.

This is followed by 24 blocks of the Foundations of Discipline Stage of
Training during which residents gain clinical experiences in medical
specialties relevant to psychiatry as well as General Inpatient Psychiatry,
General Outpatient Psychiatry, Emergency Psychiatry and Addiction Medicine.

The Core of Psychiatry Stage of Training then consists of third and fourth
year experiences in Child Psychiatry, Geriatric Psychiatry and 9 blocks of
complex care including Consultation-Liaison and Chronic Care/Rehabilitation
Psychiatry.  4 blocks of elective time has been built into the fourth year
which residents may choose to design for added flexibility around the time of
preparation for the Royal College Exam.

An exciting component overlapping the Foundations and Core Stages, is an
8-week block of Selective, designed by the resident, to gain experience in
working with marginalized populations.  This may include but is not limited to
Indigenous Mental Health, Refugee & Immigrant Health, Severe & Persistent
Mental Illness, Addictions, Dual Diagnosis, and Women's Mental Health.  It may
include clinical and/or research work.

The final year of training focuses on the resident’s Transition to Practice,
providing them with another 10 blocks of electives in areas of their choice.
3 blocks of Collaborative Care provide important experience in this vital
route of care delivery.

For all psychiatry rotations, residents choose both the site and supervisor
they prefer to work with, depending on their personal learning styles.  The
education to service ratio is a priority in the design of clinical encounters.
Training involves working in a variety of locations, utilizing a model that
emphases the psychiatrist's role within multidisciplinary teams. A
longitudinal approach is used to ensure development of skills in diagnostic
interviewing and ongoing patient management and care.

Emergency Psychiatry training includes a four-week block during the first year
of training, as well as longitudinal training over the course of residency
through on-call experiences.  

Psychotherapy training is completed in a longitudinal manner. The McMaster
Program is unique in providing comprehensive, systematic clinical training in
evidence-based psychotherapies including Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT),
Group Therapy, Psychodynamic Therapy, and Motivational Interviewing.
Opportunities for clinical training in Interpersonal Therapy (IPT), Cognitive
Processing Therapy (CPT), Prolonged Exposure (PE), Dialectical Behaviour
Therapy (DBT), Family Therapy and other evidence based therapies (e.g.
Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy) are
also available.  Residents participate in educational seminars to master
specific theoretical constructs as well as online modules.  Direct supervision
by expert faculty includes weekly review of audiotapes or videotapes of each
therapy session.

Elective time may be spent away from McMaster University. Those who are
accepted into the CIP Program may spend all of their elective time completing
coursework and research for their graduate program.



**On-Call Requirements:**

The development of emergency psychiatry skills at McMaster, Hamilton Campus,
is considered a critical component of the program's educational mandate. Call
occurs at a single centralized site in downtown Hamilton, with senior and
junior residents working together as part of a psychiatric team that includes
staff psychiatrists, skilled emergency psychiatric nurses, addictions
counsellors, social workers and emergency physicians. All residents receive
formal training in crisis intervention and the management of aggression. The
call frequency for junior residents (PGY1 & 2) and for senior residents
(PGY3-5) is 1/10 and 1/15-18, respectively, with a schedule consisting of a
mix of evening calls (ending at 11:00 PM), and overnight calls (5:00 PM to
8:00 AM). On site handover takes place each morning with an experienced
emergency psychiatrist.

Residents also gain experience with inpatient ward call, in tandem with staff
psychiatrists on call.  The location of these experiences will generally align
with the resident's current clinical rotation.  The frequency of these calls
is approximately 4 times per academic year.

In preparation for independent practice, PGY5 residents (Transition to
Practice Stage of Training) also complete on-call experiences designed to
replicate the experience of staff emergency psychiatrists in the form of
'Junior Attending' call shifts. These call shifts provide more autonomy in
clinical decision-making an managing a team of junior learners, while still
adhering to supervision guidelines and policies.

**CLINICAL TRAINING**

Our PGY1 year begins with the Transition to Discipline Stage of Training,
orienting residents to our program, the university and the local health care
system, incorporating team-building exercises and networking opportunities as
well as providing them with a review of the basic psychiatric knowledge and
skills necessary to begin their residency in Psychiatry.

First year residents then advance to complete core training in Internal
Medicine, Family Medicine, Neurology, Adolescent Medicine, Emergency Medicine,
Emergency Psychiatry and Addictions.  An exciting opportunity, unique to
McMaster, is a core rotation working with the medical team providing care to
patients admitted to Psychiatry.  During first year, residents also complete
one block of selective (chosen from Geriatric Medicine, General Pediatrics,
Developmental Pediatrics, Palliative Care, or Pediatric Neurology), and one
block of elective training from any medical, surgical or psychiatry rotation
including research.

In order to individually tailor their training, PGY2 to PGY5 residents select
the location and supervisor for each of their rotations.  Assistance is
provided to tailor rotation site and supervisor to residents' interests.
Residents are not assigned to rotations to meet clinical needs.

The second year of training further builds on the groundwork of knowledge &
skills necessary to practice Psychiatry, including building of psychiatric
assessment skills, development of differentials, implementation of management
plans for patients of low to medium complexity and performing of risk
assessments.  Expertise in emergency psychiatry is developed in preparation
for progression to the level of a senior resident by third year. Rotations
during the PGY2 year include:

  * General Adult Inpatient Psychiatry – 5.5-6 blocks
  * General Adult Outpatient Psychiatry – 5.5-6 blocks
  * Inpatient Substance Use Consultation Service - 2 weeks
  * Anchored Selective – 1 block partnered with 1 block at start of PGY3, for total of 2 blocks.  Residents choose from a wide range of opportunities to experience working with marginalized, vulnerable populations and/or further their work in research. 

Third year allows for learning in the more sub-specialized areas of Child &
Adolescent Psychiatry as well as Geriatric Psychiatry, each for 6 blocks.
Third year residents work as seniors within the emergency psychiatry
department, leading the clinical team along with the staff physician, with
lots of opportunity for teaching of junior learners.

The final two years of residency promotes advanced psychiatric skill
development and exploration of individual interests & potential career paths.

Rotations during the fourth year include:

  * Chronic Care Psychiatry - 6 blocks
  * Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry - 3 blocks
  * Elective, which may include research - 4 blocks
  * Longitudinal experience in working with those with severe and persistent mental illness

Developing increasing autonomy & preparation for transition to practice
becomes a focus particularly in the fifth year.  Residents continue to gain
experience within emergency psychiatry longitudinally, and also gain exposure
to the care delivery model of Collaborative Care.  10 blocks of elective time
allow for exploration of potential career areas, further training in areas of
personal learning need and transitioning to practice.

Electives:

  * Up to 6 blocks of elective time may be spent away from McMaster
  * Horizontal, clinical electives may be incorporated into training at one half day per week beginning in PGY3; protected, longitudinal time for research and scholarship at one half day per week may begin in PGY2

Psychotherapy Training:

The McMaster Program is unique in providing comprehensive, systematic clinical
training in evidence-based psychotherapies, including Cognitive-Behavioural
therapy (CBT), Psychodynamic Therapy, Group Therapy, and Motivational
Interviewing.  Opportunities for clinical training in Dialectical Behaviour
Therapy (DBT), Interpersonal Therapy (IPT), Cognitive Processing Therapy
(CPT), Prolonged Exposure (PE), Family Therapy and other evidence based
therapies (e.g. Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy, Acceptance and Commitment
Therapy) are also available. Training takes place in individual modules
integrated into academic streams, supplemented on-line learning through the
Psychotherapy Training e-Resource (PTeR), if desired.  Psychotherapy
supervision includes weekly review of audio or videotapes of each therapy
session.  



**Research  **

McMaster has international expertise in research design and critical
appraisal.  The Department of Psychiatry & Behavioural Neurosciences welcomes
and encourages resident participation in research. Residents may be involved
in research across a spectrum of levels of involvement. Our program has a
faculty member dedicated to promoting and assisting residents with exploring
research opportunities. An annual research marketplace for learners provides
opportunity to learn more about current projects and meet investigators.

Although formal research is not mandated, it is encouraged.  Research
experience can be gained through a spectrum of opportunities spanning from
extracurricular projects to horizontal and block electives.  In addition,
graduate studies at the Masters or PhD level can be undertaken. If these are
done through the Clinician Investigator Program (CIP), to which a resident may
apply as early as the beginning of the PGY2 year, additional close mentoring
and rigorous training in research skills and grant writing is provided.

Block elective time during which research may be pursued is available in each
year of training:

  * PGY1:  up to 1 block
  * PGY2/3:  up to 2 blocks during the Anchored Selective
  * PGY4:  up to 4 blocks
  * PGY5:  up to 10 blocks

Residents may apply for protected, longitudinal time, up to one half day per
week, to pursue research and scholarship, beginning in second year.

The minimum requirements for scholarly projects within the residency program
are:

**Academic Sessions**

Residents have one protected academic day per week.  This begins with
Department Grand Rounds which showcase scholarly presentations by national and
international speakers.   A rotation of weekly Academic Enrichment sessions
occur each Wednesday (12:30-2:00 PM), which include Diagnostic Interviewing,
OSCE prep sessions, Psychopharmacology tutorials, Evidence Based Medicine
sessions, Emergency Psychiatry Discussions as well as Complex Case Rounds.
Academic Half-Day sessions then occur through the afternoon, comprising the
formal academic curriculum.

The formal academic curriculum includes a systematic overview of psychiatric
illnesses, neuropsychiatry, evidence-based psychotherapies, principles of
critical appraisal and alternate means of delivering treatment.  Most academic
lectures take place during protected academic days during the PGY1 to the PGY5
years (there are no academic seminars during the second half of the PGY4 year,
to protect time for additional exam preparation).  The seminars align with
clinical rotations experienced in each PGY-year.  A reflective lens of equity,
diversity and inclusion is now being brought to all sessions, in addition to
those with this specific focus.

Recent changes to the core curriculum have resulted in a highly dynamic and
pedagogically robust series of learning opportunities. The core seminars are
delivered through small group sessions that start with interesting “triggers”
to promote critical reflection and discussions, short didactic lectures and
small group, case-based learning.

Reflective discussion groups are held throughout each year of training.  These
sessions are designed to promote self-reflection and increased self-awareness
of the lens through which we view and conduct our work, with the overall goal
of increasing equity and advocacy in daily practice as clinicians, scholars,
educators and future administrators.

In addition to those sessions offered on Academic Days, rotation-specific
rounds are held at each teaching centre and offer robust learning
opportunities.

**Clinical Investigator Program (CIP)**

The Clinician Investigator Program (CIP), is a national Royal College
accredited program to train the next generation of physician investigators.
McMaster CIP has a cadre of residents from the Faculty of Health Sciences
including psychiatry. The Clinician Investigator Program enables completion of
graduate studies concurrently with residency training.

The timing of the research activities is individualized and arranged with your
Psychiatry and Behavioural Neurosciences Residency Program Director.  CIP
includes a minimum of two years of research training; during these years, 80%
of the trainee’s time must be committed to research.  Trainees may enrol in a
Masters or PhD program, unless the applicant already has a doctoral graduate
degree then the research time during CIP will be spent as a postdoctoral
training. Further details about the McMaster Clinician Investigator Program
can be found at: https://pgme.mcmaster.ca/discover/enhanced-training/cip-
working-page/.

CIP offers trainees links to graduate training, monthly academic sessions with
experts, excellent mentorship from a CIP supervisory committee and Royal
College certification as a “Clinician Investigator”.  CIP training provides
individualized mentorship and promotes the development of broad and
specialized research knowledge, skills and expertise that are important for
future clinician investigators and helps trainees with their plans for an
academic career.

**Frequently Asked Questions about CIP :**

**Q:  When do residents typically begin CIP training?**

Psychiatry residents typically begin full-time CIP training in the later
stages of residency. Psychiatry residents have 17 blocks of elective time, the
majority of which occurs during PGY4 & 5, the latter in which up to 100% of
time may be spent doing research. If a resident begins CIP in PGY5, they
usually apply for CIP funding to complete a second CIP year as a PGY6.

**Q:  Can I do a graduate degree earlier in my residency as part of CIP?**

Yes, however the graduate training has to fulfill the CIP requirements. For
example, a graduate degree needs to be a research-based (i.e., thesis
requirement), and not exclusively a course-based degree. CIP requires that you
dedicate 80% of time on research during a 24 month period.

**Q:**  **What advantages does CIP offer beyond research skills that can be
acquired through research electives?**

CIP advantages include:

  * Coordination of clinical and research training
  * Academic research sessions and peer contact
  * Completion of course work can be done during residency, which is salaried
  * Assistance and support in obtaining protected time to engage in longitudinal research
  * Royal College certification of CIP training upon completion of program requirements

**Q:   If am a graduate from MD/PhD programs or I have obtained previous
doctoral graduate degree prior to medical school, am I still eligible to apply
to CIP?  If so, do I have to complete another degree?**

Residents in this position are still eligible to apply to CIP. Post-doctoral
positions require advance consideration prior to admission. Further
information can be found at https://pgme.mcmaster.ca/discover/enhanced-
training/cip-working-page/.
