# Program Highlights

The McMaster Diagnostic and Clinical Pathology (DCP)/General Pathology Program
has a stellar reputation for graduating residents who are valued for the depth
of skill and expertise they provide in the wide breadth of the discipline. The
Program's strengths are an organized, yet flexible curriculum plan tailored to
fit each resident’s needs, a cohesive resident group, highly responsive
program admin, dedicated faculty and a driven Program Director who is a
previous graduate of the Program.  
  
**I. CONTENT AND ORGANIZATION OF THE PROGRAM**  

**Please see Program Curriculum Section**  

  
**II. RESOURCES**  

The Program provides numerous funds for residents for books, travel to
conferences as well as research grants. The Program appoints academic coaches
for each resident early in PGY1 to help monitor progress. McMaster Diagnostic
and Clinical Pathology (DCP)/General Pathology also offers a mentorship
program in addition to academic coaches which allows residents to approach
staff within their areas of interest for career planning advice. We are also
affiliated with numerous community sites (which are reimbursed through
MacCare) including but not limited to Oakville, Brantford, Kitchener Waterloo
etc. The Program is also extremely proud to have liasioned with Mackenzie
Health to provide residents the opportunity to be involved with Digital
Pathology sign-out.  
  
**III. ACADEMIC AND SCHOLARLY ASPECTS OF THE PROGRAM**  
  
Mandatory academic half days are every Wednesday morning (anatomical
pathology) and afternoon session (Diagnostic and Clinical Pathology
(DCP)/General Pathology) . Residents also present journal clubs and
interesting slide review rounds. DCP residents routinely attend Transfusion
Medicine Boot camp. Furthermore, PGME McMaster has numerous sessions on career
development, teaching to teach, financial planning, wellness etc.  

  
Residents are expected to present at the Annual Residents Research Day. PGY 2
residents often work up an interesting case; however in later years they are
encouraged to undertake more comprehensive projects. DCP residents present at
various local, national and international conferences.  
  
**IV. EVALUATION OF RESIDENT PERFORMANCE**  
  
During rotations, residents submit relevant Entrustable Professional Activity
forms (EPAs) to staff they work with. A midterm evaluation is completed by the
rotation supervisor. At the end of each rotation a standard resident
evaluation form will be completed by the rotation supervisor with input from
other staff as appropriate. Residents will also complete an exit exam after
the end of most rotations. Yearly subscription to the American Society of
Clinical Pathology exam (RISE) Exam is paid for by the Program. The Program
also organizes Annual in-house exams as well as May slide Exam for additional
testing to help residents prepare for their Royal College examination.



The Competence Committee evaluates resident progress and provides feedback
regularly to the resident and their academic coach. The CC uses numerous data
to help inform decisions related to promotion including but not limited to
number of EPAs generated, number of specimens seen (based on resident’s
electronic log), number of successful EPAs, ITARs, Exam scores, academic coach
report etc.

**V.   RESEARCH FUNDING**

Residents have access to the Pathology and Molecular Medicine (PMM) Department
Resident Research Grant to which they can submit at any given time. This is in
addition to multiple different grants available through hospital services,
McMaster and the Royal College.

# Program Curriculum

This residency program is for 5 years.

Program length of training does not exceed the Royal College or College of
Family Physicians of Canada standard.

**Competency-Based Medical Education (CBME):**  

Physician training focuses on achievement of outcomes and based on a framework
of competencies (CanMEDS). The Competence Continuum divides residency training
into four stages: Transition to discipline, Foundations of discipline, Core of
discipline and, finally, Transition to practice.



PGY 1:

_Transition to Discipline stage (TTD):_ 2 blocks: First block introductory
Boot camp covering basics of the laboratory including normal histology
followed by 1 Block Anatomical Pathology  

_Foundation stage:_ 11 blocks:  Autopsy (1 block), Surgical Oncology,
Hematology, infectious disease, Medical Oncology, Endocrinology, Pediatric
Oncology, and remainder Anatomical Pathology blocks



PGY 2-5 :

_Core stage:_ 46 blocks: Anatomical Pathology (including subspecialties),
Hematopathology/hematology, Medical Microbiology, Medical Biochemistry,
Community Hospitals and Elective/Research rotations. Royal College Examination
will take place at the end of Core stage in a 2 step manner: written and
practical in Spring of PGY4 and Oral exam in Fall of PGY5 unless otherwise
mentioned on the Royal College website.



_Transition to Practice stage (TTP):_ 6 blocks: Senior resident rotations in
Anatomical Pathology Hematopathology/hematology, Medical Microbiology, Medical
Biochemistry, and research/elective

# Training Sites

McMaster University postgraduate programs are integrated in cooperation with
the affiliated teaching hospitals St. Joseph's Healthcare and Hamilton Health
Sciences. The regionalized laboratory services in Hamilton, one of the first
in Canada, provide cost-effective patient care through 4 main hospital sites:
McMaster University Medical Center, St. Joseph’s Hospital, Juravinski Hospital
and Cancer center and Hamilton General Hospital.  

Each site in Hamilton has specific areas of expertise with associated
clinicopathological rounds providing a broad experience in Diagnostic and
Clinical Pathology (DCP)/General Pathology. Each site has designated resident
spaces with full workstations and a wide resident library that is frequently
updated (in addition to electronic resources access through the McMaster
library). Site and rotation supervisors have clear guidelines for resident
orientation, scheduling, and wellness. In addition, residents have access to a
wellness coordinator and ombudsperson for support as required.

# Additional Information

LIVING IN HAMILTON  
  
Hamilton is uniquely situated in the Golden Horseshoe region – close to
Toronto and all of its attractions, yet far enough away from the fast city
pace of the big city. Hamilton is immersed in rich cultural activities and
events. There is easy access to parks, conservation areas, walking and biking
trails. For individuals with families, there are many family orientated
communities with good schooling.
