# Important Information

As education innovators, we implemented CBME two years prior to our national
peers enabling us to develop experience and expertise in this training model.  



**COVID-19 vaccination requirements:**

Please refer to the 'Restrictions' section of the [Ontario eligibility
criteria](https://www.carms.ca/match/r-1-main-residency-match/eligibility-
criteria/ontario/) for messaging regarding COVID-19 vaccination requirements.

**EDIIA Institutional Statement:**

The goal of resident selection is to identify trainees likely to succeed both
in training and, once out in practice, in meeting the health care needs of
patients and Canadian society.  We know that having a physician workforce that
reflects the demographics of the patients that they serve improves health care
outcomes.  There are many populations within Canada under-represented in
medicine (UIM) with a paucity of health care practitioners who are Black,
Indigenous, Persons of Colour, 2SLGBTQ+, from lower socioeconomic backgrounds
and/or with disabilities, and other under-represented in medicine (UIM)
groups. Diversity within training programs has also been shown to improve
training environments.  Queen’s University PGME is strongly committed to
diversity and inclusion within its community for these reasons as well as
being part of the solution to address historic and contemporary inequities.

**Equity and diversity**

We welcome diversity among our trainees and seek to foster an environment that
is welcoming to all, regardless of gender identity, race, religion, or sexual
orientation.

We are committed to advancing equitable and inclusive practices.  Please refer
to the [PGME website](https://meds.queensu.ca/academics/postgraduate/faculty-
staff/applicant-selection) for additional information / resources including
[QHS EDIIA Initiatives](https://healthsci.queensu.ca/academics/edi) and [EDIIA
statements](https://healthsci.queensu.ca/academics/edi/accessibility-
statements) (Indigenous Land Acknowledgement, Anti-Discrimination Statement,
Inclusion Statement, and Statement on Social Accountability)

**Gaps in Training, Remediation, or Professionalism issues**

Please address any gaps in training, remediation, or professionalism issues in
your personal letter as a separate paragraph. This will not count towards your
maximum word count.

verify your citizenship or permanent resident status. If your status is
verified by one of these organizations, you will not need to provide
citizenship documents in your application. If your citizenship status is not

# Program Highlights

Diagnostic and Molecular Pathology

The Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine at Queen's University
offers excellent training for individuals pursuing careers in either community
hospital-based or academic pathology.  The core programs are supported by
state-of-the-art flow cytometry, cytogenetics and molecular DNA diagnostic
laboratories and training in each of these areas is provided.  A busy regional
cancer clinic is associated with the hospital, allowing a wide range of
oncology related pathology.  Pediatric pathology is integrated in a horizontal
fashion throughout the program.  An expanding catchment area with a large
consultative service ensures an excellent mix of case material and numbers to
provide a more than adequate volume.  As a Regional Forensics Centre trainees
receive excellent training in Forensic Pathology.  A long tradition of
training Anatomical Pathologists at Queen's has ensured excellence and success
amongst our Residents (https://pathology.queensu.ca).

# Program Curriculum

This residency program is for 5 years.

Program length of training does not exceed the Royal College or College of
Family Physicians of Canada standard.

Diagnostic and Molecular Pathology -- Quick Facts  
  

Opportunities for interprovincial and international electives while training.  
Surgical specimens number approximately 30,000 per year.  
Autopsy cases number approximately 450 per year.  
Cytology cases number approximately 12,000 cases per year.  
Access to electronic medical resources provided.

Please see below for training and research.

  
  

Diagnostic and Molecular Pathology

The training program is organized into four stages, (transition to discipline,
foundations of discipline, core of discipline and transition to practice) and
progression through the stages occurs after the trainee demonstrates
competence in specific professional activities associated with each level.
The competency based approach provides frequent low-stakes formative feedback
so that the learning experience can be focused to individual needs/goals.  The
essence of how pathology is taught will not change, but by adopting a
competency based approach, the trainee will be assured that they are a
competent pathologist at the end of their residency ready for independent
practice or fellowship training.

The Department has a strong commitment to providing research training for
residents who are preparing for an academic career.  Within the Department
there are numerous opportunities to work in established laboratories which are
using multidisciplinary techniques to investigate aspects of amyloidogenesis
and Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, the molecular biology of cancer,
coagulation and fibrinolysis, cytogenetics and neuropathology to mention a
few. A [clinician investigator program](https://meds.queensu.ca/academics/cip
"CIP") is available for residents who are keen to pursue a graduate degree
during their residency training.

  
  

Education Sessions

Our academic half-day series runs on a two year cycle such that residents have
the opportunity to revisit subjects in their senior years.  This series covers
the central topics in Diagnostic and Molecular Pathology including diagnostic
pathology in the diagnostic subspecialties, lab management and advanced
diagnostics (genetics).  In addition there are weekly micro rounds, gross
rounds, autopsy rounds, neuropathology rounds.  Also, there are regular soft
tissue and bone, renal biopsy, pediatric, liver biopsy rounds.  Journal clubs
and an annual departmental research day help develop scholarly ability.
