Regional Connection Attestation

## **Download Form:  [TMU Regional Connection
Attestation](https://www.carms.ca/pdfs/TMU-regional-connection-
attestation-2025.pdf)**

We understand that a number of applicants to our residency programs will have
a connection to the Peel region and surrounding communities, and that many
applicants will also have an interest in serving culturally diverse and
medically underserved communities.  
  
Building upon our strong foundation of social accountability, we have
implemented a **Regional Connection Attestation** to help identify candidates
who may have a connection to the region.  
  
All applicants are asked to complete this attestation. The information
provided in the attestation will be considered in our selection process and
candidates will be awarded a Regional Connection Score.

Self-identification questionnaire

Equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) are fundamental values at TMU and the
School of Medicine. As the first medical school in Canada founded and
intentionally built upon the foundations of social accountability, EDI,
decolonization and Reconciliation. These principles have been intentionally
infused throughout all facets of the TMU School of Medicine, including
admissions.  
  
We recognize that many groups face barriers not only in applying and being
admitted to medical school, but also in matching into residency programs. With
this in mind, and in keeping with TMU’s mission, vision and values,**  our
PGME Office and residency programs are asking applicants to optionally
complete the CaRMS Self-Identification Questionnaire and to assign the
document with their application to our program.**  
  
**This information will be used to support our goal of selecting a diverse
group of candidates to interview and subsequently rank**. Your information
will also be used to produce aggregate data. Following the CaRMS Match,
anonymized aggregate data from the CSIQ will be used to evaluate the
effectiveness of our selection process in removing barriers and promoting
inclusion, and to help us set EDI goals for future matches.

All members of the TMU PGME Office, program faculty and staff, file reviewers,
interviewers, and program selection committees undergo mandatory unconscious
bias and anti-racism training specifically geared to admissions and selection
and must also sign a Confidentiality and Conflict of Interest Agreement.
Additionally, to help ensure an equitable and accessible admissions and
selection process, we are committed to providing reasonable accommodations for
candidates who may require them in the interview process.

# Program Curriculum

This residency program is for 2 years.

Program length of training does not exceed the Royal College or College of
Family Physicians of Canada standard.

**Family Medicine Rotations (Family Medicine and Family Medicine - Urgent
Care)**

These rotations form the cornerstone of the residency, offering a
comprehensive experience in Family Medicine. Residents will care for patients
across their lifespans, from pediatrics to geriatrics, addressing various
medical needs including preventive care, chronic disease management, mental
health, and minor procedures.

Notably, six out of the eight blocks will be conducted within the same
community teaching clinic, providing continuity of care and allowing residents
to build long-term relationships with their patients. This consistency in the
clinical environment is designed to enhance the development of skills
necessary for delivering patient-centred care. The remaining two blocks will
be completed in an urgent care or walk-in clinic, where residents will gain
experience managing a high volume of low-acuity conditions in a fast-paced
environment.

**Pediatrics**

The Pediatrics rotation offers residents a broad spectrum of experiences, from
emergency consultations to routine outpatient care. This rotation is crucial
for developing the skills necessary to care for children from infancy through
adolescence, emphasizing the evaluation, treatment, and management of common
pediatric illnesses and well-child care.

**General Internal Medicine**

This rotation is structured to emulate the responsibilities of a hospitalist,
allowing residents to manage complex cases in both inpatient and outpatient
settings. The experience gained in diagnosing and treating acute, chronic, and
end-of-life conditions will equip residents with a comprehensive skill set in
internal medicine.

**Obstetrics and Gynecology**

During this rotation, residents will be exposed to a wide range of obstetric
and gynecological conditions in inpatient and outpatient settings. The
rotation encompasses pre-pregnancy planning, prenatal care, labour and
delivery, postpartum care, and gynecological health, preparing residents to
function effectively as generalists in women's health.

**Mental Health and Addiction Medicine**

This rotation is focused on developing the skills required to address mental
health needs and substance use disorders. Residents will work in psychiatric
settings and collaborate with mental health professionals, gaining experience
in patient-centred communication, diagnosis, and management of mental health
and addiction issues commonly encountered in primary care.

**Emergency Medicine**

The Emergency Medicine rotation trains residents in triage, rapid assessment,
and management of acute presentations of diseases and trauma. Residents will
develop skills in prioritizing and managing multiple patients simultaneously,
emphasizing timely intervention and appropriate referral to specialists.

**Care of the Elderly/Palliative Care**

In this mixed-block rotation, residents will gain experience managing chronic
medical issues in the elderly and providing palliative care. The rotation
includes clinical placements in various settings, including clinics, long-term
care, and home visits, emphasizing the importance of continuity of care and
developing long-term patient relationships.

**Rural Medicine**

This rotation allows residents to train in rural and remote communities,
offering exposure to the broad scope of family medicine practice in these
communities. The experience gained in managing patient care in resource-
limited environments will be invaluable. Work is underway to expand this
rotation to work with and learn from Indigenous communities and embed the
Indigenous ways of knowing, being, and doing into the training.

**Electives**

Elective rotations are designed to allow residents to gain additional clinical
or academic exposure in areas of personal interest, further enhancing their
ability to function as family physicians in diverse settings. These rotations
complement the core Family Medicine experience and can be completed within or
outside affiliated teaching hospitals and clinics.

**Selectives: Outpatient Surgical Skills (OSS)**

The OSS selective allows residents to refine procedural skills in a range of
clinical settings within the affiliated teaching hospitals and clinics.
Experiences may include minor surgical procedures, gynecological procedures,
dermatological biopsies, and orthopedic interventions, fostering confidence in
the technical aspects of patient care.

**Selectives: Outpatient Specialty Clinic (OSC)**

The OSC selective offers residents exposure to various medical disciplines in
outpatient settings within the affiliated teaching hospitals and clinics,
focusing on managing chronic medical conditions. The rotation provides
valuable experience in the longitudinal care of patients with diverse health
needs, contributing to a well-rounded medical education. Clinical experiences
may include breastfeeding clinics, colposcopy clinics, early arthritis
clinics, endoscopy clinics, or wound clinics. The options are vast and allow
for individualization to each resident’s needs and interests.

**Quality Improvement**

A core component of the PGME Resident curriculum will be conducting a Quality
Improvement project (QI) to be submitted by the middle of their second year of
residency. Residents will be introduced to QI principles in their first year
of residency. Residents will be encouraged to think of a topic or relevant
area for improvement as they progress throughout their residency.  Dedicated
time in Academic Half Day (AHD) will be provided for residents to form groups,
plan their projects, etc. After submission, the projects will be presented at
an AHD session, and faculty will select a ‘winning project’ that will receive
an award at graduation.

**PGME Foundational Curriculum**

The PGME Foundational Curriculum has been designed to address competencies
that are not always fostered within the clinical learning environment with a
consistent approach across PGME programs.

The PGME Foundational Curriculum will include a Research and Critical
Appraisal Course to ensure that core research and scholarship content is
delivered to all PGME Residents. Recognizing the huge diversity of research
methods, the Research and Critical Appraisal Course Course will link to
additional resources and outside courses that will allow them some
individualization in learning content relevant to individual Residents’
particular research endeavours.

Residents will be encouraged to seek out any research or quality improvement
projects they are interested in, and appropriate Faculty support will be
provided as needed. This may include creating their own project, or working
with a family physician faculty member on an existing project.

School of Medicine announces additional partnerships, the sites for core
program rotations may change. Residency training will leverage a distributed
model which may include training at any of these sites for learning in
environments, which include community and clinical settings, urban and rural
environments, and inpatient and outpatient settings. While the majority of
resident training will be focused in Peel and surrounding communities,
additional learning experiences may take place at other training sites within
Canada through Inter-University Affiliation Agreements. These agreements are
subject to change and result in training at sites other than those that are
listed above.

Travel to various locations will be required. Access to a personal vehicle
will be beneficial, though anyone with access to a reliable means of
transportation is encouraged to consider this program.

# Additional Information

A novel program called LEARN (Leadership, Education, Advocacy, Research, and
Non-clinical) Time will allow residents to access protected time that they may
direct toward opportunities for experiential learning activities.

  * It is anticipated that many residents will leverage this time to participate in work worthy of publication and scholarly work. While this program will be overseen by the Family Medicine Residency Program’s Competence Subcommittees, central support for some elements of the LEARN Time program will also be provided. In particular, annual LEARN Time events will connect residents with individuals working in other areas of TMU, Brampton/Peel, and surrounding committees. This will allow for some ‘scholarly matchmaking’ to happen outside of the Family Medicine Residency Program to connect Residents with a broader array of scholarly opportunities than would exist solely within the Family Medicine Residency Program.  
  

  * Residents may also use LEARN time to engage in other Leadership and Advocacy work, such as with the Ontario Medical Association (OMA), Professional Association of Residents of Ontario (PARO), College of Family Physicians of Canada (CFPC) and Ontario College of Family Physicians (OCFP), allowing residents to engage with formal leadership and other opportunities early on in their careers. They may also choose to engage in formal teaching and mentorship of TMU School of Medicine undergraduate medical students. They will be provided a formal curriculum as well as informal mentorship opportunities for developing teaching skills.
