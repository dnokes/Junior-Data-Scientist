### PGY4

Specialty Training in Internal Medicine requires four years of approved
residency training which includes three foundational years and one year of
“advanced internal medicine training”. This Core Internal Medicine (CIM) PGY-4
year has Royal College mandatory rotations as outlined below. Moreover, the U
of A CIM has created a set rotation default curriculum we encourage all CIM
PGY-4 trainees to adhere to. If there are specific goals or rotations a
trainee would like, outside of the set rotations, these may be considered in
discussion with the Associate Program Director responsible for this year,
and/or the CIM Program Director.

The approval by the RCPSC of General Internal Medicine (GIM) as a subspecialty
of internal medicine, allows residents the option of remaining in the Core
Internal Medicine program for their PGY4 year. Simultaneously, the GIM
subspecialty Residency Training program provides a two year curriculum to all
residents who match to the 2 year GIM program in the Medicine Subspecialty
Match. At the University of Alberta, these changes were implemented over the
2013/14 Academic year. For those seeking to pursue a career in General
Internal Medicine, the GIM subspecialty program is preferentially recommended
to permit additional development of niche skills, and to maximize recruitment
potential (e.g. Academic or urban centre GIM). The Core IM program at the
University of Alberta fully adheres to the General Standards of Accreditation.
The following points will describe the goals, objectives, structure,
organization, resources and curriculum of our PGY4 advanced Internal Medicine
Training.

_**NOTE:**  General Internal Medicine at the University of Alberta is a
subspecialty of Internal Medicine and is a 2-year program (PGY4 and PGY5 years
in GIM)._

#### **Goals & Objectives**

  * The overall goals of the internal medicine program are inclusive of the PGY4 year. As of 2017, the primary focus of these goals is the completion of entrustable professional activities (EPAs) in all four stages. The primary focus of the PGY4 year is the transition to practice stage. Completion of CIM EPA's including "Transition to Practice" is mandatory for progressing as expected required to graduate from the Internal Medicine Residency Program.
  * Specific educational objectives are developed for all rotations provided in the PGY4 year. These are included in the biannual mini-program review of the RPC.

#### Structure and Organization-Required

Minimum 20 half-day clinics over 12 months. To develop the skills required to
confidently practice ambulatory medicine, the Royal College requires that a
longitudinal clinic be undertaken. Clinic may be GIM or any other subspecialty
of Medicine. The PGY4 resident will be asked to identify, contact and confirm
a preceptor for their longitudinal 3 months prior to the start of their PGY-4
year, at the latest. If a preceptor is not found by the trainee prior to this
deadline, then a clinic/preceptor will be chosen and provided to the trainee.

#### PGY4 Rotation List (not in sequential order)

  * Jr Attending (2 blocks): One of UAH, RAH, GNH (Mandatory, Royal College Requirement)
    * This is organized in collaboration with the General Internal Medicine program, and can be undertaken at either an academic or community teaching hospital, depending on the resident’s goals, preferences, and site availability. The resident functions under the supervision of the attending physician in a clinical teaching unit or preceptor-based teaching unit, assuming their primary duties. They are given as much independence as permitted by ability, licensure restrictions and hospital policy, in preparation for transition to independent practice.
  * ICU: Suggest MCH or GNH – more procedures, more medicine ICU, fewer/no competing trainees for procedures (Mandatory, Royal College Requirement)
    * Having completed only two blocks of Critical Care training in the PGY1-3 years, the PGY4 resident should complete one additional block of critical care training, with graduated responsibility, as appropriate to the intended practice setting in internal medicine.
  * Community medicine: SCH, MCH, Red Deer (Mandatory)
  * Rural Medicine: Grande Prairie, Yellowknife, (BC possibly if interest) (Mandatory, Royal College Requirement)
    * The PGY4 resident participates in a general practice in internal medicine in a community outside of Edmonton and may include Grande Prairie, Yellowknife, potentially BC interior/north/island if able to secure rotation electively through UBC. The program will also be flexible in approving other settings that may be of interest to the residents.
  * GIM consult service at RAH including Pre-op Clinic (Mandatory)
  * ECG Rotation RAH (includes CCU call) (Mandatory)
  * Neurology at GNH – mix of acute/subacute stroke, general neurology, inpatient plus outpatient clinics (including stroke, headache clinic, general neuro clinic), in a preceptorship model. No overnight call required. (Mandatory)
  * Obstetrical medicine (Mandatory)
  * Ambulatory block (Mandatory, Royal College Requirement)
    * The PGY4 resident should participate in one month of ambulatory clinics in internal medicine. The goal is approximately 28 half-day clinics in a rotation block in a community-based setting (ie. 7 half-day clinics per week)
  * POCUS block (Recommended)
  * Elective
  * Vacation (4 weeks total, may be taken in increments of 1, 2, 3, or 4 weeks)

#### Resources

  * As with other residents in the core program, the teaching staff for PGY4 residents will be derived from the Department of Medicine as a whole rather than unduly expecting any single division such as General Internal Medicine to shoulder this responsibility.
  * The PGY4 resident will have access to the same computers and facilities for information management, on-line references and computer searches as the other residents in the program. This includes the resident lounge and locker space.
  * The program will provide funding for a NEJM Knowledge Plus subscription. 

#### **Academic Program**

  * Internal Medicine Academic Half Day. The PGY4 resident has the option of attending the CIM academic half day on Thursdays. If not the academic half day, then usual clinical service per the rotation is required 
  * Quality Improvement. EPA TP8 "Identifying/Analyzing system-level safety" - PGY-4 Residents will have the following options for completion of this EPA:
    * Prepare and present a QA (Quality Assurance) rounds (one hour talk) at one of the hospital sites or at the CIM Academic Half day, with an Attending supervisor overseeing your presentation.
    * Complete the IHI (Institute for Healthcare Improvement) Patient Safety or QI online modules outlined at this link: [https://www.ihi.org/education/ihi-open-school/Pages/Curriculum.aspx](https://www.ihi.org/education/ihi-open-school/Pages/Curriculum.aspx)
    * Complete a Quality Improvement project (the program will help you find a supervisor for the project)

### Assessment of Resident Performance

  * Rotation ITERs
  * EPA Observations – continuation from PGY1-3. CBME was implemented at the U of A CIM program in July 2017. CBME became mandatory for CIM PGY-4 in July 2022 with a requirement to complete EPAs for the Transition to Practice (TP) stage. A minimum of 3 EPA attempts per week are required (except while on vacation) in order to remain on pace. The CIM Competence Committee will review EPA progress and may recommend minor or major learning plans for failure to complete or maintain pace.
    * Personal Learning Plan. Residents should complete one narrative reflection after each rotation and formal assessment encounter, and continue with case-based reflections as per FD7. These can be completed in Assess.Med and reviewed in Portfolio.Med (Transition to Practice, under TP7 Narrative Form). The narrative reflection can be about a challenging diagnostic dilemma, challenging interaction with a patient/patient family or other health care team member, a reflection on the rotation and what skills have been gained and how they will be incorporated into your future practice or a reflection on any challenges this rotation has highlighted in terms of practicing independently.
    * Multi-source Feedback. Residents should receive multi-source feedback during at least one of the two Junior attending rotations, using the same mechanism that was used in the PGY3 year.

### **Seminars**

The core program provides for approximately 5-8 hours per week of seminar
time, including a daily morning report (General Medicine and the
subspecialties of Gastroenterology, Nephrology, Pulmonary, and Hematology),
daily noon rounds hosted by various subspecialties, weekly Grand Medical
Rounds, and weekly CATs (critically appraised topics) sessions for the R1s.
The Academic Half-Day occurs weekly, and is actively prepared and participated
in by residents. It includes core lecture topics on current management
strategies, reviews of landmark studies, small group problem-based learning
sessions and physical exam skills training, ethics discussions, and journal
clubs - all fully supported by the department's faculty.

# Training Sites

  *  University of Alberta Hospital
  *  Royal Alexandra Hospital
  *  Cross Cancer Institute
  *  Grey Nuns Hospital, Grey Nuns (Palliative facility), and Northern Alberta Regional Geriatric facility at the Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital
  *  GIM selective / Community:  Grande Prairie, Red Deer, Sturgeon Community Hospital (St. Albert) rotations

 We encourage residents to consider inter-provincial and international
electives if possible. Each resident is entitled to 4 weeks of elective time
per year; however, residents are strongly encouraged to take 1-2 months of
elective time in their R-II year to prepare for the R-IV match process.
Accumulation of all 3 months of elective time into the RIII year is not
permitted. Elective time may be spent on an experience outside the program or
outside the University as long as it is considered relevant to Internal
Medicine. Rural General Internal Medicine rotations are available.

Ratio of residents to faculty is approximately 5 to 1.

Average patient load is approximately 8 to 18 patients per resident, depending
on the service. Some divisions have non-teaching services which helps with the
service load.

All our residents to partake in a one month rotation in Grande Prairie, Red
Deer, or other approved community IM site which provides a fabulous experience
for residents interested in subspecialty and general medicine.

medicine.The pursuit of diversity and equitable opportunities is a core value
that guides our selection practices.

The University encourages applications from underrepresented groups, including
Indigenous persons, persons with a disability, racialized persons, women,
persons of a minority gender identity or sexual orientation, and individuals
who would contribute to the diversity of the medical community. The CaRMS
Self-Identification Questionnaire (CSIQ) is an optional form that candidates
can fill out.

Our program recognizes the importance of EDIDI and anti-racism in residency
selection, but is currently not using the CSIQ as part of our application
process. We are using other methods to ensure mitigation of bias and equitable
opportunities for all applicants.



**OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION:  ****Sample Resident Feedback on Some of the
Unique Rotations at University of Alberta**

**Two Week CanMEDs rotation:  **

  * Was a nice change from clinical work and allowed for ample time to really invest in the learning material and gain a broader understanding of ethics. The discussions that were had were very applicable to what I see in my day to day work. 
  * High-yield for a 2 week course.  This was a great rotation.
  * Allowed for great discussion and personal reflection.  Overall, fantastic rotation that all senior residents will find helpful

**Simulation Academic ½ Day:**

  * I found the scenarios challenging and I learn something new every time I do one.
  * Really wish we had more, it was an awesome experience!!
  * Very useful sessions to learn to approach emergencies under controlled situations.  Good facilitators
  * Excellent opportunity for formative feedback on collaborator / leadership skills.
  * I wish we had more of these sessions since it does help to think of emergencies and go through scenarios before potentially encountering them on the wards.

**GIM Selective: Grande Prairie**

  * Good learning and great rotation
  * Good exposure to acute and critical medicine
  * Opportunities for procedures 

**GIM Selective: Red Deer**

  * Exposure to community medicine - ambulatory and acute care perspective.
  * Red Deer was an amazing experience with a lot of independence and hands on experience, especially with endoscopic technical skills. I would highly recommend this rotation to anyone who is interested in a subspecialty or more independent learning.
  * The spectrum of cases to be seen in the community is great; hands on, procedures, independence.
